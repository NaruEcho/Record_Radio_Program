Hello everyone. You are listening to Enjoy Simple English. 森崎ウィンです。

00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:19,536
毎週木曜日は、Winston from the West. 2019年度に放送した古典が語る西洋の知恵をお送りいたします。

00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:27,596
今日お送りするのは、あの有名なThe Rabbit and the Turtle. ウサギとカメです。早速聞いてみましょう。

4
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:38,371
It was a beautiful day in the mountains.

5
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,371
The wind blew gently,

6
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:44,371
and the sun shone through the leaves in the trees.

7
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:47,031
All the animals on the mountain

8
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:51,031
were enjoying the afternoon together quietly.

9
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:55,031
Then, a rabbit started to talk.

10
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:58,031
Let's do something!

11
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,031
Oh, I know!

12
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:03,371
Let's see who can run the fastest!

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,790
That sounds like a good idea.

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,490
Turtle, do you want to race with me?

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,490
Yes, it sounds like fun.

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,590
Ha ha ha, but you are so slow.

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,230
You have such short legs and a heavy shell on your back.

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,950
How are you going to run?

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,610
I don't have to run to win a race.

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,230
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:37,783
Don't you know that I can run fast like the wind?

22
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:42,203
I know you are fast, but I will win.

23
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,643
Will you race with me?

24
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:48,823
Or are you afraid to lose against the turtle?

25
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:52,803
Ha ha ha! This is really funny!

26
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:58,363
But if you want to lose, I will race with you!

27
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:05,575
そこで フォックスが 始まり 目的地 目的地 目的地を 選んでくれました

28
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:11,835
その日 ラビットとトルトルは 始まり線に立ち

29
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:15,215
フォックスが 試合を 始めるのを 待ちました

30
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,395
全ての動物は その周りに 立ち上がって 笑顔をしていました

31
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:23,635
レディー セット ゴー!

32
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:28,735
ラビットは 風が速く 飛び出しました

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,340
and the turtle started walking at his usual speed

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,040
The rabbit ran and ran until he was far ahead of the turtle

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
He stopped for a moment

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,540
Hahaha! The turtle is so slow!

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,740
I know I will win this race!

38
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,940
He can never catch me now!

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,080
Oh!

40
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,498
What a beautiful day!

41
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,158
The grass is so soft here

42
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,058
I think I will rest for a while

43
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:10,278
Then I will run to the goal

44
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:14,378
So the rabbit lay down on the grass

45
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,198
and closed his eyes

46
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,978
He didn't plan to stay long

47
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:23,078
But the gentle sunshine and the wind felt good

48
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,098
and he became sleepy

49
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:27,078
In a few minutes

50
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,375
ラベットは寝ていた

51
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,375
ラベットが寝ていたら

52
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,375
トルトルは歩き続けた

53
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,375
一度も止まらなかった

54
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,375
歩いて歩いて

55
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,375
ゴールに近づいていた

56
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,375
ラベットは起きて

57
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,375
ああ、いい感じだ!

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,375
今、また走り始める準備ができた!

59
00:03:55,675 --> 00:04:02,675
レッツ シー ウェア イズ ザ スロー トゥ トゥ トゥ ウォッ オー ノー

60
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:38,227
この物語はもう小さい頃から聞かされた物語ですね

61
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,827
僕の今台本にあなたはどっちですかって書いてあるんですけれども

62
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,787
僕は多分うさぎです

63
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:48,247
地道にコツコツやること大事ですね

64
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,547
それではSee you tomorrow
