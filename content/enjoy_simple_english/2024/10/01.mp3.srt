こんにちは、田中信一です

40
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,560
私は日本から来ています

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
初めて会いました

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,520
田中さん、どのくらい前に日本に住んでいたのですか?

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,720
2ヶ月です

44
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,223
That's not very long.

45
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:11,763
Before Germany, I lived in Italy. Gelato is very buono.

46
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,903
I see. How long were you in Italy?

47
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:21,843
The same as Germany, two months. I want to make lots of new amigos.

48
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:26,883
Amigos? Did you also live in Spain?

49
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:28,703
I did.

50
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:33,263
Wow! You have lived in many countries, haven't you?

51
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:40,114
Yes, my father's hobby is moving, so we move every two months.

52
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,154
That's quite a lot.

53
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,094
Obrigado, shukuran, tak.

54
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:52,694
That's thank you in Portuguese, Arabic and Swedish.

55
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:58,914
Wow, but why did you say thank you?

56
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:03,925
I always learn how to say thank you in a new language

57
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:05,925
That makes sense

58
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:13,785
By the way, did you also live in Mexico, Scotland, Texas and

59
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,465
うずまさきょうと

00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:19,345
I did! How did you know?

61
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:25,565
Well, you're wearing a colorful poncho, a kilt, cowboy boots

62
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,785
and your hair is in the samurai chonmage style

63
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,768
いやーこのコメディは面白い

00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:47,348
