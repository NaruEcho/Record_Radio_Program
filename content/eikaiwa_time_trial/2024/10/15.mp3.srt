1
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:34,319
 今回はレストランなどでの注文にまつわる表現を練習します。

2
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:37,339
 まず、注文するときの基本表現。

3
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:39,319
 何々にします。

4
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:42,319
 これを英語で言うと、

5
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,499
 答えは、

6
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,669
 I'll have.

7
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:49,949
 I will have, or 短く, I'll have 〜。

8
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,149
 以前も練習しましたね。

9
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,349
 それを応用して、

10
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:57,569
 例えば、最初は〜にします。

11
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,929
 あるいは、〜だけにします。

12
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,929
 など、今回表現できるようになりましょう。

13
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,289
 And one more thing today,

14
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:08,429
 our radio show will be in almost all English.

15
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,569
 今日のレッスンはほぼオールイングリッシュで進みます。

16
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:13,429
 You can do it!

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,330
 Okay, it's time for your first try.

18
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,050
 S-P-R-J

19
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:28,590
 Now, I'll say something in Japanese and you express it in English within the time limit.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,510
 Before we do the first one, how do you say saisho ni in English?

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,770
 Saisho ni is to start.

22
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:44,274
 So, let's use to start to say this phrase.

23
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,894
 最初に何か飲み物はいかがですか?

24
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:51,214
 To start, would you...

25
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:52,334
 軽い言ってみよう。

26
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:52,754
 Go ahead.

27
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,454
 Here's the next one.

28
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,534
 最初はオレンジジュースにします。

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,420
 どれくらいおなかがすいていますか?

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,180
 それほどおなかはすいていません。

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,180
 サラダだけにします。

32
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,760
 OK, let's go to the next one.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,140
 First, how do you say ぜんさい?

34
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:47,615
 The answer is appetizer.

35
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:51,595
 Okay, use appetizer to say this.

36
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:54,475
 前菜だけにします。

37
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,755
 割とお腹が空いています。

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,560
 Okay, let's go to the next sentence.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,480
 その前に料理の2,3品

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,580
 How do you say that in English?

41
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,780
 The answer is 2 or 3 dishes.

42
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,120
 Okay, use 2 or 3 dishes to say this.

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
 料理を2,3品注文してシェアしますか?

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,340
 Shall we?

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,340
 Go ahead.

46
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,743
 OK, here's the next one.

47
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:48,423
 すみません、注文をお願いします。

48
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:56,423
 この料理にします。

49
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:05,423
 その料理を食べてみるのがすごく楽しみです。

50
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,630
 OK, time's up. How did you do? Did you try to say each one?

51
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,330
 Now, Jenny and I will show you the sample answers and give you some advice.

52
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,910
 So listen closely.

53
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,010
 最初に何か飲み物はいかがですか?

54
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,770
 To start, would you like something to drink?

55
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,770
 最初はオレンジジュースにします。

56
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,410
 To start, I'll have some orange juice.

57
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:50,267
 So, we use the phrase to start and then 注文する定番表現.

58
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:55,687
 I'll have そして飲み物の前によく酢酸も使いますね。

59
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,527
 To start, I'll have some orange juice.

60
00:04:58,847 --> 00:04:59,647
 Here's the next one.

61
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:02,787
 どれくらいお腹が空いていますか?

62
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,007
 How hungry are you?

63
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,007
 それほどお腹は空いていません。

64
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,847
 I'm not that hungry.

65
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,147
 サラダだけにします。

66
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:19,847
 I'll just have a salad.

67
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,947
 料理一品ですから、a salad。

68
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:26,047
 Here's the next one.

69
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,287
 前菜だけにします。

70
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,627
 I'll just have an appetizer.

71
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,127
 割とお腹が空いています。

72
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,747
 I'm pretty hungry.

73
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:45,207
 料理を二、三品注文してシェアしますか?

74
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:49,897
 Shall we order two or three dishes and share?

75
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:55,937
 Sumimasen, chumon wo onegai shimasu.

76
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,457
 Excuse me, we'd like to order.

77
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:07,117
 You wait for someone to come near your table, or you make eye contact, and then say this.

78
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:09,337
 Excuse me, we'd like to order.

79
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:11,837
 Alright, here's the next one.

80
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,157
 Kono ryouri ni shimasu.

81
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:16,628
 I'll have this dish.

82
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:23,688
 Sometimes on a menu, the name of the dish is very difficult to pronounce,

83
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:26,248
 even for native speakers like me.

84
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,688
 And in that case, I point to the menu and say,

85
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,108
 I'll have this dish.

86
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:37,008
 Sono ryōri o tabete miru no ga sugo ku tanoshimi desu.

87
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,928
 I'm so excited to try that dish.

88
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,388
 To say tanoshimi, there are three phrases.

89
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,920
 I'm looking forward to, I'm so excited to, or I can't wait to.

90
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,380
 All are fine.

91
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,100
 しかし、ものすごく楽しみ。

92
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,320
 For that, instead of looking forward to, I suggest I'm so excited to, plus a verb.

93
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,540
 I'm so excited to try that dish.

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,340
 Okay. Did you understand today's phrases?

95
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,580
 All right. Now it's your turn to try them one more time.

96
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,539
 This is your chance to do a little better than before.

97
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,359
 Okay, let's go.

98
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,319
 最初に何か飲み物はいかがですか?

99
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:29,559
 To start, would you like something to drink?

100
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,839
 最初はオレンジジュースにします。

101
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:43,013
 To start, I'll have some orange juice.

102
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:47,253
 どれくらいお腹が空いていますか?

103
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,993
 How hungry are you?

104
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:57,993
 それほどお腹は空いていません。

105
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,373
 I'm not that hungry.

106
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,093
 サラダだけにします。

107
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,688
 I'll just have a salad.

108
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:18,888
 前菜だけにします。

109
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:24,528
 I'll just have an appetizer.

110
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:29,888
 割とお腹が空いています。

111
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:34,048
 I'm pretty hungry.

112
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,888
 料理を2、3品注文してシェアしますか?

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,240
 Shall we order two or three dishes and share?

114
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,840
 すみません。注文をお願いします。

115
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,960
 Excuse me. We'd like to order.

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,840
 この料理にします。

117
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,840
 I'll have this dish.

118
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,520
 Sono ryori wo tabete miru no ga sugoku tanoshimi desu.

119
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,160
 I'm so excited to try that dish.

120
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,020
 Alright, everyone. Time's up.

121
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:40,520
 Well, how did you do? Those are some great phrases for ordering at a restaurant. You'll use those a lot when you travel.

122
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,889
 So everyone, get on board.

123
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,609
 And let's practice speaking together.

124
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,289
 See you next time on...

125
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,949
 Ekaewa Time Trial.

126
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:50,849
 Bye-bye.
