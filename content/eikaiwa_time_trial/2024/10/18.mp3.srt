1
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:21,136
 Let's get started with Day 15 for the month of October.

2
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:27,836
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sarese, and here's your conversation partner around the Atlantic.

3
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:34,016
 Hi, everyone. I'm Nora Kennedy. Let's have a conversation in Ireland.

4
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,936
 All right. We'll finish our month with this.

5
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:42,136
 Taiwa Karaoke. Around the Atlantic.

6
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:47,425
 ラジオを通して英語で模擬会話をしましょう。

7
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:49,345
 英語でつながる船の旅。

8
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,965
 あなたはアイロランドに来ています。

9
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:55,525
 ということで早速、今日の会話の場面を確認しましょう。

10
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:56,705
 Imagine this.

11
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:05,805
 Today, you and I are going to have breakfast at a nice restaurant in Dublin.

12
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:07,925
 It's the capital of Ireland.

13
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:16,537
 あなたは今日、ノラさんとアイルランドの首都ダブリンにあるレストランで朝食をとることになりました。

14
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:19,357
 It's not an easy restaurant to find.

15
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,977
 It's not in most guidebooks.

16
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,457
 But the food is terrific, and the atmosphere is lovely.

17
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:34,537
 そこは穴場のレストランで、雰囲気も良く料理も美味しいようですよ。

18
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:36,537
 This morning...

19
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:39,474
 We are having something very Irish.

20
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:41,934
 A full Irish breakfast.

21
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,834
 Irelandならではの朝食セット

22
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:49,834
 Full Irish breakfastを注文しましょう。

23
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,694
 Did you picture the situation?

24
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,834
 それでは、野良さんの英語の問いかけに対して

25
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,794
 ポーズの間に自由に英語で返答しましょう。

26
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:03,294
 今週練習したフレーズを使ってみてもOKですよ。

27
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:05,174
 So, try to have

28
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:08,907
 seven-turn conversation. We'll enjoy

29
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:12,527
 a full Irish breakfast. Ready?

30
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:19,127
 Start!

31
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:23,007
 You made it to the restaurant. Was it hard to find?

32
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:29,287
 It's great to see you.

33
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:33,007
 Have a seat. How do you like this restaurant?

34
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:40,578
 restaurant no can so she took auto

35
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:42,858
 to start

36
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:49,258
 we'd you like something to drink

37
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:52,118
 okay here's a menu

38
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:59,118
 how hungry are you

39
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,138
 we can order on a cart

40
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,725
 But I like the full Irish breakfast here.

41
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:11,105
 せっかくなので、アイルランドならではの朝食セットを注文しましょう。

42
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:27,105
 The full Irish breakfast comes with black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and eggs.

43
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:28,965
 How would you like your eggs?

44
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:33,803
 卵はどのように調理してもらいたいか聞かれました。

45
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:35,283
 自由に答えましょう。

46
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,443
 どうぞ。

47
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:41,243
 All right.

48
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,423
 I'm getting hungry.

49
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,503
 一言返しましょう。

50
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:46,503
 どうぞ。

51
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,203
 Time's up.

52
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,703
 Did you try to reply each time?

53
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:03,105
 アイルランドの食べ物についてノラさんに聞きましょう。

54
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:06,645
 Today we talked about a full Irish breakfast.

55
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:13,925
 Yes, you absolutely have to have a full Irish breakfast when you go to Ireland.

56
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:18,625
 And it's pretty much the same everywhere, but there are some regional variations.

57
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:23,625
 アイルランドに行ったらぜひフルアイルランドの食べ物を体験してください。

58
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:27,611
 How about your hometown?

59
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,611
 Can you have full Irish breakfast in your hometown?

60
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:31,791
 Sure.

61
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:37,051
 We would have a full Irish breakfast with black pudding and white pudding.

62
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:38,311
 I see.

63
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,771
 By the way, you said your hometown is New Mullet?

64
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:43,291
 No.

65
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,071
 Bell Mullet.

66
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,131
 My apologies.

67
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:45,971
 No problem.

68
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,491
 Your hometown is Bell Mullet?

69
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:47,871
 Yeah.

70
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,991
 What kind of food is your hometown famous for?

71
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:57,764
 Well, because it's by the sea, there's lots of delicious seafood like oysters or lobsters.

72
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:06,384
 But also, because the lambs in the spring, when they're born, they eat the grass by the seaside, which has a kind of salty flavour.

73
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:09,764
 The grass has salt in it because it's by the sea?

74
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:10,544
 The seaside, right?

75
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:18,024
 So, this kind of lamb is called salt marsh lamb and it has a lovely, naturally salty taste.

76
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:18,244
 Wow.

77
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,532
 That's a wonderful story.

78
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:25,112
 So there's a natural salty seasoning to the lamb.

79
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,752
 食べてみたいですね。

80
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:31,392
 さあ、それでは、英会話のトレーニングに戻りましょう。

81
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:34,172
 ノラさんと僕で今日の会話をしてみます。

82
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:36,512
 僕のフルアイリッシュブレックフェスについての

83
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,972
 返答をチェックして参考にしてください。

84
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,992
 Steve will show you one way to reply.

85
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,072
 Listen carefully.

86
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,283
 You made it to the restaurant. Was it hard to find?

87
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,583
 Not really. Sorry if I kept you waiting.

88
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,663
 It's great to see you. Have a seat.

89
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,423
 How do you like this restaurant?

90
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:04,143
 This Irish restaurant is charming.

91
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,823
 To start, would you like something to drink?

92
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,903
 I'll just have some water for now.

93
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:13,443
 OK. Here's a menu.

94
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:16,243
 How hungry are you?

95
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:21,007
 I'm pretty hungry, but I usually don't eat that much.

96
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:27,307
 We can order à la carte, but I like the full Irish breakfast here.

97
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:33,587
 We're in Ireland, so we might as well try a full Irish breakfast.

98
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:43,087
 The full Irish breakfast comes with black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and eggs.

99
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,827
 How would you like your eggs?

100
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,019
 May I have my eggs sunny-side up?

101
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,299
 All right. I'm getting hungry.

102
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,719
 Me too. I'm so excited to try those dishes.

103
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,859
 Okay. Did you understand our conversation?

104
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,339
 最後に、野良さんが、I'm getting hungry.

105
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:11,719
 これは質問ではない問いかけですので、自分なりに答えてください。

106
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,719
 僕は、Me too.

107
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:19,215
 You can stop there, but if you can, please tell us how much you're looking forward to it.

108
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:22,215
 I'm so excited to try those dishes.

109
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:27,055
 Finally, let's try the Mogi conversation again today.

110
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:30,655
 Please challenge yourself to see if you can give your own answer.

111
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:32,975
 Do your best, everyone.

112
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:35,375
 Ready, start!

113
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,775
 You made it to the restaurant!

114
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,610
 Was it hard to find?

115
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,110
 It's great to see you. Have a seat.

116
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,630
 How do you like this restaurant?

117
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,050
 To start, would you like something to drink?

118
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,610
 Okay, here's a menu.

119
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,530
 How hungry are you?

120
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:24,688
 We can order a la carte, but I like the full Irish breakfast here.

121
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:29,688
 Since we're here, let's order a set of breakfasts unique to Ireland.

122
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:45,688
 The full Irish breakfast comes with black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and eggs.

123
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,888
 How would you like your eggs?

124
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,559
 All right. I'm getting hungry.

125
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,619
 Okay, time's up.

126
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,879
 Great job this month, everyone.

127
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,599
 Did you enjoy our journey around Ireland?

128
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:20,679
 I enjoyed learning about Ireland from you. Thanks, Nora.

129
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,319
 My pleasure, Steve.

130
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:28,172
 さて、英語でつながる船の旅はまだまだ続きます。

131
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:29,752
 来月向かうのは、

132
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,952
 We're going to Iceland!

133
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:36,872
 来月は野良さんとアイスランドに行きますよ。

134
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:40,212
 You'll really improve your conversation skills there.

135
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:42,572
 And everyone, get on board!

136
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:45,752
 And let's practice speaking together.

137
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,112
 See you next time on...

138
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,912
 Eikaiwa Time Trial!

139
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:50,812
 Bye-bye!
