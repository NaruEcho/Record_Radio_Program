1
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:21,428
 Let's get started with Day 14 for the month of October.

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,008
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sarese.

3
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:27,548
 And I'm Jenny Skidmore. Thanks for joining us.

4
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:31,868
 It's Thursday. Let's practice the phrases we learned this week.

5
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,568
 And we'll get you ready for actual conversations.

6
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:37,768
 All right, let's get started.

7
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:39,308
 Express.

8
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:40,048
 Create.

9
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,148
 Reply.

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,833
 Let's do some warming up.

11
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,893
 Step 1. Express.

12
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:54,733
 Ima kara Jenny-san ga konshuu rinshu shita hyougen o random ni itte kuremasu no de,

13
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:59,513
 nani mo minai de zenbu ripiito dekiru ka challenge shite mite kudasai.

14
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:03,433
 So, try to repeat each phrase after me.

15
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,813
 And copy my intonation.

16
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:09,033
 Okay, here we go.

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,990
 This Irish restaurant is charming.

18
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,730
 Our table is over there.

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,070
 I like the music and the atmosphere.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,950
 Let's have a seat.

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,170
 Today's specials are written on that board.

22
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:43,273
 How hungry are you?

23
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:47,313
 I'm pretty hungry.

24
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:56,293
 All right. Did you express all those phrases quickly and smoothly?

25
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,893
 And now, let's move on to the next step.

26
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:04,073
 Step 2. Create.

27
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:10,893
 Next, let's use the phrases we learned this week and create some original sentences.

28
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,051
 Here's the first one.

29
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,631
 Saisho ni nani nani wa ikaga desu ka?

30
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,151
 To start, would you like nani nani?

31
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:25,551
 You can imagine you're at a restaurant or you're entertaining someone at home.

32
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:26,691
 Are you ready?

33
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,591
 To start, would you like...

34
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,071
 Go ahead.

35
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:39,451
 Okay.

36
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,734
 Now, let's check out Jenny's sentence.

37
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:43,654
 Jenny?

38
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:47,374
 To start, would you like an appetizer?

39
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,014
 Good.

40
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,574
 To start, would you like an appetizer?

41
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:52,994
 Okay.

42
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,814
 Now, try to make one more with

43
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:57,974
 To start, would you like something?

44
00:02:58,814 --> 00:02:59,394
 Dewa ikimashou.

45
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,074
 To start, would you like...

46
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:02,654
 Go ahead.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,400
 では2つ目のフレーズです。

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
 最初は何々にします。

49
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,000
 To start, I'll have 〇〇。

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,240
 Now you're ordering.

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,260
 最初に何を注文するか伝えましょう。

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,500
 Ready?

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
 To start, I'll have...

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,500
 Go ahead.

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,960
 Good!

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,700
 Now it's Jenny's turn.

57
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,516
 To start, I'll have the cheese platter.

58
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,616
 That's a good one.

59
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,856
 Moriabase in English is often platter.

60
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:51,396
 For example, cheese no moriabase, cheese platter.

61
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:54,976
 Jenny said, to start, I'll have the cheese platter.

62
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:56,836
 All right.

63
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,376
 Use your imagination and order something with this phrase.

64
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:03,196
 To start, I'll have...

65
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:03,616
 Go ahead.

66
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:12,752
 Very good.

67
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:16,412
 では、三つ目の表現に行きましょう。

68
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:20,472
 この料理には何々がついています。

69
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:23,752
 This dish comes with 〇〇。

70
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,592
 So imagine you're at a restaurant and you tell a friend,

71
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:28,252
 This dish comes with something.

72
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:29,972
 Are you ready to create?

73
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:32,712
 This dish comes with...

74
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:33,172
 Go ahead.

75
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,842
 Okay, let's see what Jenny creates.

76
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:48,202
 This dish comes with a dessert.

77
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:50,342
 That's a good one.

78
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,622
 This dish comes with a dessert.

79
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:56,162
 それではもう一度文を作りましょう。

80
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:56,982
 It's your turn again.

81
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,502
 This dish comes with...

82
00:04:59,502 --> 00:04:59,982
 Go ahead.

83
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:10,822
 Okay, now let's move on to our final step.

84
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,881
 Step 3. Reply.

85
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,521
 Next, we'll practice something important.

86
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,561
 You'll reply in English to some questions.

87
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,741
 Just use your own words.

88
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,521
 Here's the first one.

89
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,021
 想像してください。

90
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:32,021
 あなたは僕と朝食を取ることになりました。

91
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:35,961
 レストランにやってきたあなたに声をかけます。

92
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,661
 You made it to the restaurant.

93
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,741
 Was it hard to find?

94
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:44,696
 お店は見つけにくかったですか?と聞いていますので、

95
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:48,156
 You can start with yes or no, and then add one sentence.

96
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:49,236
 Are you ready?

97
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,016
 You made it to the restaurant. Was it hard to find?

98
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:53,916
 Go ahead.

99
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:08,736
 Okay, let's check out Jenny's sample reply.

100
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,360
 You made it to the restaurant. Was it hard to find?

101
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,520
 Not really. Sorry if I kept you waiting.

102
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
 First, Jenny said, not really.

103
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,200
 Yesでも noでもなく、それほどではありませんでした。

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,780
 Not really.

105
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,040
 And then she said, sorry if I kept you waiting.

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 お待たせしていたなら、すみません。

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,460
 Okay, it's your turn to try one more time.

108
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
 I'll ask the same question.

109
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,295
 Try to reply within the time limit.

110
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:40,215
 Here we go.

111
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,315
 You made it to the restaurant.

112
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,675
 Was it hard to find?

113
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:56,115
 Okay, let's go to the second question.

114
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:59,475
 朝食を注文する前に、

115
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:02,115
 飲み物を注文しようと提案します。

116
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,995
 To start, would you like something to drink?

117
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:07,295
 自由に返答してください。

118
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:08,186
 Are you ready?

119
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:11,346
 To start, would you like something to drink?

120
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:12,266
 Go ahead.

121
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:24,826
 Okay, let's check out a sample reply.

122
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:28,186
 To start, would you like something to drink?

123
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:31,626
 I'll just have some water for now.

124
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:34,926
 とりあえず in English is for now.

125
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:36,606
 So, Jenny said.

126
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:39,945
 I'll just have some water, tori-aizu, for now.

127
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,225
 Alright, it's your turn to try again.

128
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,065
 I'll ask the same question.

129
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,145
 To start, would you like something to drink?

130
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,665
 Good job!

131
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:00,085
 Let's go to the last question.

132
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:04,565
 どれくらいお腹が空いているか聞きます。

133
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:05,825
 How hungry are you?

134
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,625
 いや、いろいろ食べ物の話してますから、きっとお腹すいてますね。

135
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,585
 You must be hungry.

136
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,745
 Because we've been talking about food, right, Jenny?

137
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:13,625
 Yeah.

138
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,305
 Actually, I'm getting hungry, too.

139
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:17,245
 Me, too.

140
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,585
 Okay, so here's a good question.

141
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,785
 自分なりに答えてください。

142
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,005
 How hungry are you?

143
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:23,885
 Go ahead.

144
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:34,585
 Okay.

145
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:36,482
 Let's see how Jenny replies.

146
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:38,442
 How hungry are you?

147
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:43,582
 I'm pretty hungry, but I usually don't eat that much.

148
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:46,222
 わりとおなかすいています。

149
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,442
 I'm pretty hungry.

150
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,282
 And then Jenny said,

151
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:52,462
 But I usually don't eat that much.

152
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:56,282
 ふだんはそんなにたくさん食べないですよ。

153
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:57,482
 OK.

154
00:08:57,982 --> 00:08:59,962
 You can use that phrase or another,

155
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,202
 but just reply in your own words.

156
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,382
 And let's try this one more time.

157
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:06,764
 How hungry are you?

158
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,844
 Okay, time's up.

159
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,824
 Great job today, everyone.

160
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:24,804
 All right, you're ready for tomorrow's conversation.

161
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,364
 It's Taiwacaroke.

162
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:30,104
 You're going to a charming restaurant in Ireland.

163
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,244
 And you'll have a full Irish breakfast.

164
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:38,072
 今週練習した表現をぜひ明日使ってみてくださいね。

165
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,292
 Sounds like a fun one.

166
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,792
 So everyone, get on board.

167
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:44,512
 And let's practice speaking together.

168
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,172
 See you next time on...

169
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:49,252
 英会話タイムトライアル。

170
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:49,732
 Bye-bye.
