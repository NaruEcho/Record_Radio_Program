1
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:21,245
Let's get started with Day 5 for the month of October

2
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,965
Hi everyone, I'm Steve Sarese

3
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:27,985
今年度のテーマは英語でつながる船の旅

4
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:31,085
今月向かうのはアイルランドです

5
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:35,945
ということで早速一緒に旅をする会話パートナーを呼びましょう

6
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:37,545
この方です

7
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:40,765
Hi everyone, I'm Nora Kennedy

8
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,565
I'll be your conversation partner

9
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,702
Welcome back to Eikaiwa Time Trial, Nora.

10
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:48,022
Thanks, Steve.

11
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:51,562
So we're going to Ireland, your home country.

12
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:53,482
Yes, very exciting.

13
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:57,202
アイルランドといえば何を思い浮かべますか?

14
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:02,082
I think people think of Ireland as being a bit like Hokkaido.

15
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:06,542
It's green, the rivers are clean, the sea is beautiful,

16
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:10,282
and it's a really great place to enjoy nature.

17
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:11,582
I see.

18
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:14,082
And how about food?

19
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:18,383
Ah, food is Ireland's speciality.

20
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:21,423
We make amazing cheese, like blue cheese,

21
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,723
Casual blue cheese is really good.

22
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:27,563
We make lots of butter, amazing lamb, beef.

23
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:31,063
Irish food is excellent, and oysters, of course.

24
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,103
Woo!

25
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:34,483
That's perfect, because, Nora,

26
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:36,823
this month, we're talking about food.

27
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:39,163
Great, my favorite topic.

28
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:41,243
Let's get started.

29
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,163
Taiwa Karaoke

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,680
ラジオを通して英語で模擬会話をする実践的なトレーニングです

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,300
早速今日の会話の場面を確認しましょう

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,980
今日はアイルランデと向かうクルーズ船で開催されるお寿司のランチパーティーに参加します

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,310
It's a special kind of sushi. We make it ourselves. 手巻き寿司

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,690
今回は野良さんと手巻き寿司を作ります

35
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,410
So, could you help me with it?

36
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:31,230
野良さんに手巻き寿司の作り方や 日本の食材について上手に説明しましょう

37
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,910
Did you picture the situation?

38
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,490
では野良さんの英語の問いかけに対して ポーズの間に英語で返答してみましょう

39
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:46,515
So, try to have a seven-turn conversation as we have lunch on the cruise.

40
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,195
Ready, start!

41
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:57,875
Oh, hello! Are you going to the special sushi lunch, too?

42
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,595
自分も行くと伝えましょう。どうぞ。

43
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:09,975
Alright! Today we have Teimaki Sushi.

44
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:17,075
am i saying that properly 正しく手巻き寿司を発音できていたか聞かれました

45
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,535
一言返しましょう

46
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:26,555
do you often make sushi at home in japan

47
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:35,995
oh here is the sushi buffet

48
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:41,581
First, we get this black, dark green, thin thing.

49
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,601
What do you call this?

50
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:48,081
ここでノリについてしっかり説明しましょう。どうぞ。

51
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,021
I see.

52
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,971
How much rice should I put on the nori?

53
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,311
Oh, I'll spread the rice out with this rice spoon?

54
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,231
Next, do I put soy sauce on the rice?

55
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,851
ご飯の上にお醤油をかけるか聞かれました

56
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,591
自由に答えましょう

57
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:42,344
So, now I'll put in some fish. I'll have Irish smoked salmon.

58
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,624
What kind of fish are you going to put in your sushi?

59
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:56,404
Time's up!

60
00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:00,184
How did you do? Did you reply to each one?

61
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,144
それでは、野良さんと僕でこの会話をしてみます。

62
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:07,337
僕の返答をチェックして参考にしてみてください

63
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:11,137
スティーブは一つの答えを教えてくれます

64
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:12,597
行ってみましょう

65
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:17,697
おー、こんにちは

66
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,777
スシランチに行ってもいいですか?

67
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:23,637
ええ、一緒に行ってみましょう

68
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,037
いいね

69
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:28,757
今日は手巻き寿司を食べます

70
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:31,017
正しく言っていいですか?

71
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,597
手巻き寿司は結構いい言葉です

72
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:38,255
Do you often make sushi at home in Japan?

73
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,855
Not really. We usually go to our neighborhood sushi restaurant.

74
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:46,255
Oh, here is the sushi buffet.

75
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:51,655
First, we get this black, dark green, thin thing.

76
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,655
What do you call this?

77
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:55,255
It's called nori.

78
00:05:55,255 --> 00:06:01,255
Some people call it seaweed in English, but seaweed might not be an appetizing word.

79
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,695
It's a kind of sea plant.

80
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:12,462
I see. How much rice should I put on the nori?

81
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:19,722
Just don't put too much rice on it. If you put too much rice on it, it will be hard to make a roll.

82
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:24,282
Oh, I'll spread the rice out with this rice spoon.

83
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:28,202
Next, do I put soy sauce on the rice?

84
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:34,242
Well, you can, but I dip it in soy sauce right before I eat it.

85
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,662
So, now I'll put in some fish.

86
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,582
I'll have Irish smoked salmon.

87
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,862
What kind of fish are you going to put in your sushi?

88
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,622
Fresh tuna or maguro.

89
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:50,862
But actually, this is minced tuna called negitoro.

90
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,862
Okay, good.

91
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:59,385
Did you understand our conversation?

92
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:02,545
We're talking about food, sushi.

93
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:07,405
Nora, what is your favorite sushi meta or fish?

94
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:09,845
That's an easy question.

95
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,805
It's scallop or hotate.

96
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:15,945
Oh, that's one of my favorites as well.

97
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,285
皆さんいかがですか?Do you like scallops?

98
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,065
それでは、最後にもう一度今日の模擬会話に挑戦です。

99

I see. How much rice should I put on the nori?

110
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,858
Oh, I'll spread the rice out with this rice spoon.

111
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:49,798
Next, do I put soy sauce on the rice?

112
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:50,058
Yes.

113
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:02,532
