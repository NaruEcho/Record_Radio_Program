1
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:21,164
 Let's get started with Day 10 for the month of October.

2
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:27,484
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sarese, and here's your conversation partner around the Atlantic.

3
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:30,684
 Hi, everyone. I'm Nora Kennedy.

4
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:36,964
 Just try to complete the conversation with me today in your own words.

5
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:38,524
 Here we go!

6
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:42,744
 Taiwa Harake. Around the Atlantic.

7
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:46,844
 ラジオを通して英語で模擬会話をしましょう

8
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:49,024
 英語でつながる船の旅

9
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:51,464
 今月はアイロランドに行きます

10
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:54,464
 And do you remember our theme?

11
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:58,504
 Cuisine together in Ireland

12
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:01,224
 味わい深い料理の会話

13
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:04,484
 So, let's check out today's scene

14
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:06,184
 Imagine this

15
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:12,644
 We go to the rolling hills of Ireland

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,700
 For a picnic with friends.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,120
 あなたは今日、ノラさん、そしてノラさんの友人数人と一緒にピクニックに行くことになりました。

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,660
 場所はきれいな景色が広がるアイロランドの丘の上です。

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,800
 It's a potluck, so everyone brings one dish.

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,400
 今回はポトラック、料理持ち寄りのピクニックです。

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,700
 Just tell us about what you brought.

22
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:42,872
 Is it something Japanese?

23
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:48,872
 あなたは何を持ってきたのか聞かれるので、料理を自由に想像しましょう。

24
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:53,872
 そして、その料理には何が入っているかなども聞かれます。

25
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:56,892
 Did you picture the situation?

26
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:02,872
 それでは、野良さんの英語の問いかけに対して、ポーズの間に英語で返答しましょう。

27
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,872
 今週練習した表現を使ってみてもOKですよ。

28
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,332
 Ready, start!

29
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:18,348
 Oh, you made it. Say hi to everyone.

30
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:23,768
 さあ、ノラスターの友人たちに元気よく挨拶しましょう。どうぞ。

31
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:30,268
 ジア・グッチ。

32
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:33,308
 Well, help yourself to some Irish food.

33
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:37,948
 Shepherd's pie, soda bread, or Irish stew here.

34
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,088
 Are you a meat eater?

35
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,684
 Okay, start with this.

36
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,664
 Oh, I see you brought a dish for us.

37
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:52,224
 What dish did you bring?

38
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:56,684
 何の料理を持ってきたのか、自由に答えましょう。

39
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,584
 どうぞ。

40
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:05,504
 It sounds good.

41
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,564
 So, what's in it?

42
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:24,616
 I think I know of that dish. It's not very spicy, right?

43
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,876
 Let's pass around paper plates.

44
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:42,296
 And for your dish, should we use a serving fork or serving chopsticks?

45
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,988
 OK. Everyone, enjoy.

46
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:56,748
 And would you like to try Irish soda bread?

47
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,768
 Ireland's traditional bread, soda bread, was recommended.

48
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:04,388
 Let's say a word. Please.

49
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,068
 OK. Time's up.

50
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,128
 How many times did you reply?

51
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,772
 It's okay if it's not the first time.

52
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:26,032
 After this, Nora and I will try this conversation.

53
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,992
 And lastly, there's one more chance.

54
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:33,672
 Before that, let's talk a little about Ireland with Nora.

55
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:39,332
 So, what do people say in Japan when you tell them you're from Ireland?

56
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,512
 Well, they always say,

57
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:45,472
 Oh, you're from Ireland. It must be so cold.

58
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:48,132
 Oh, it's not cold in Ireland?

59
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,132
 No.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:58,660
 Actually, even though Ireland is more northerly than Hokkaido, it's actually quite mild, and it never snows.

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,200
 Really?

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,980
 Yeah.

63
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,420
 Hokkaidoよりアイルランドの方が緯度が高いのに雪が降らないんですね。

64
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,560
 そしてそこまで寒くないと野良さんがおっしゃってますね。

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,180
 それでは野良さんと僕で今日の会話をしてみます。

66
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,200
 僕の返答をチェックして参考にしてみてください。

67
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:22,208
 Steve will show you one way to reply. Listen carefully.

68
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:29,208
 Oh, you made it. Say hi to everyone.

69
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:34,208
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve. Geoguch.

70
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:39,208
 Geoguch. Well, help yourself to some Irish food.

71
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:44,088
 Shepherd's pie, soda bread, or Irish stew here.

72
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 Are you a meat-eater?

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 Yes, I have meat all the time.

74
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 OK, start with this.

75
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 Oh, I see you brought a dish for us.

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
 What dish did you bring?

77
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 I brought stir-fried noodles.

78
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 This dish is called yakisoba.

79
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
 It sounds good.

80
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 So, what's in it?

81
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,080
 It has vegetables, pork and noodles in it.

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,020
 And you could put some nori on it if you like.

83
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:19,204
 Ah, I think I know of that dish. It's not very spicy, right?

84
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:26,444
 Right, but you can add this seasoning called shchimi. It has a mix of seven spices in it.

85
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:35,804
 Let's pass around paper plates. And for your dish, should we use a serving fork or serving chopsticks?

86
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:42,564
 I usually use chopsticks, but a serving fork might be easier for everyone.

87
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,880
 OK. Everyone, enjoy. And would you like to try Irish soda bread?

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,040
 Oh, I've never had soda bread. What's in it?

89
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,140
 OK. Did you understand our conversation?

90
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,100
 So, let's try again today's Mogi conversation.

91
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,900
 It's not the same answer as my reply.

92
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:13,124
 自分なりのヘントできるかどうかチャレンジしてください。

93
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:14,984
 Do your best, everyone.

94
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,384
 Ready, start!

95
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,884
 Oh, you made it!

96
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:26,264
 Say hi to everyone!

97
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:32,884
 ジアグッチ!

98
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:36,524
 Well, help yourself to some Irish food.

99
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,604
 Shepherd's pie, soda bread...

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,140

103
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:22,976
 I think I know of that dish. It's not very spicy, right?

104
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,396
 Let's pass around paper plates.

105
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:40,816
 And for your dish, should we use a serving fork or serving chopsticks?

106
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:41,616
 Chopsticks.

107
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:51,488
 OK. Everyone, enjoy.

108
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,248
 And would you like to try Irish soda bread?

109
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:05,608
 Time's up.

110
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:10,668
 OK. You did much better the second time. Great job.

111
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:12,188
 How was your second challenge?

112
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:14,788
 Next week.

113
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:19,636
 We're going to a nice restaurant in the capital of Ireland, Dublin.

114
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,096
 That's right.

115
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:28,216
 来週の金曜日は野良さんとアイルランドの首都、ダブリンのレストランに行きます。

116
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,536
 I'm really looking forward to it.

117
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:33,256
 OK, everyone. Get on board.

118
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:36,476
 And let's practice speaking together.

119
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,896
 See you next time on...

120
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,396
 Eikaiwa Time Trial.
