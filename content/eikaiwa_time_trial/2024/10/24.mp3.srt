 まずはウォーミングアップをしましょう。

11
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:52,523
 今からジェニーさんが今週練習した表現をランダムに言ってくれますので、

12
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:57,483
 何も見ないで全部リピートできるかチャレンジしてみてください。

13
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:04,123
 ジェニーさんのイントネーションも真似してみてください。

14
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,472
 So try to say it quickly and smoothly.

15
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,612
 And copy my intonation.

16
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,932
 Okay, here we go.

17
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:18,112

 Does it have sugar in it?

23
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,090
 My daughter is a picky eater.

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,290
 All right.

25
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,470
 Did you express all those phrases quickly and smoothly?

26
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,130
 And now, let's move on to the next step.

27
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:05,168
 Step 2. Create.

28
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:12,628

31
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:21,228
 Help yourself to 何々。

32
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:26,168
 料理名を入れてそれを自由に取るように呼びかけましょう。

33
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,828
 飲み物でもいいですよ。

34
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:28,288

00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,313
 では、同じフレーズを使って、

44
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:58,413
 もう一度文を作ってみてください。

45
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,673
 Now try to create one more sentence.

46
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,693
 Help yourself to...

47
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:04,193
 どうぞ。

48
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,327

 It's one of my favorite salads.

61
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:01,057
