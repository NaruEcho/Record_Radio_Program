1
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,929
 You can talk to me, we can laugh and smile.

2
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:15,829
 A Kiowa time trial.

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:21,149
 Let's get started with Day 13 for the month of September.

4
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,709
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Ceresi.

5
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,329
 And I'm Jenny Skidmore. Thanks for joining us.

6
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,709
 It's our last SPR training this month, and we have something special.

7
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,069
 We'll talk about kimonos.

8
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:42,265
 You might wear a kimono, or with so many tourists coming to Japan and renting kimonos,

9
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:44,805
 you might have a conversation about a kimono.

10
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:50,765
 Soko de kimono wo mite, oh, beautiful kimono dake de waru no de wa nakute,

11
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:58,105
 niyau to ka, ariba kimono ni tsuite kikareta toki ni kotaeru benrina hyougen mo awasete minitsukimashou.

12
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:02,825
 And once again, today's lesson will be in almost all English.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,880
 今回もほぼオーディングして頑張りましょう。

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,500
 OK, let's begin with our first time trial.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,460
 S-P-R Training

16
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,340
 I'll say something in Japanese,

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,840
 and you express it in English within the time limit.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,440
 Here's the first one.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,660
 その着物はあなたにすごく似合っていますね。

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,720
 Start with,

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,440
 That kimono looks...

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,820
 Go ahead.

23
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:41,156
 Good. Here's the next one.

24
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,156
 Nihonde kaimashita ka?

25
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,156
 Dokode kaimashita ka?

26
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:58,156
 Sono tabi wa dokode kaimashita ka?

27
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:03,956
 For tabi, just use tabi socks. Go ahead.

28
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:33,296
 Start with, but I haven't.

29
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,336
 Go ahead.

30
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:45,462
 お正月には必ず着物を着ます。

31
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:48,482
 Start with, I always wear...

32
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:48,922
 Go ahead.

33
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:58,922
 母は割とよく着物を着ます。

34
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:08,922
 この着物について教えますね。

35
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:18,323
 これは京都で作られました。

36
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,563
 母がくれました。

37
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:32,303
 OK, time's up.

38
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:33,463
 How did you do?

39
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:35,663
 Did you try to say each one?

40
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:41,283
 Now, Jenny and I will show you the sample answers and give you some advice.

41
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:42,923
 So listen closely.

42
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,300
 その着物はあなたにすごく似合っていますね。

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,920
 That kimono looks great on you.

44
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,160
 すごく似合ってます is 〜 looks great on you.

45
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,060
 Imagine Jenny is wearing a kimono, and let's say it to her.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,880
 Jenny, that kimono looks great on you.

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,360
 いってみよう。

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,180
 Well, thanks.

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,380
 Here's the next one.

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,560
 日本で買いましたか?

51
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:16,831
 Did you get it in Japan?

52
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,931
 どこで買いましたか?

53
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,271
 Where did you get it?

54
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,291
 そのタビはどこで買いましたか?

55
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,531
 Where did you get those tabi socks?

56
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:36,691
 There's no direct translation for tabi in English.

57
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:39,971
 So, I suggest tabi socks.

58
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,711
 Some people say toe socks.

59
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:47,813
 But when we're talking about kimono, we might as well introduce the word tabi this way.

60
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,973
 Where did you get those tabi socks?

61
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:52,393
 Okay, here's the next one.

62
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,033
 よく着物を着ますか?

63
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,213
 Do you wear a kimono often?

64
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,933
 クローゼットに着物があります。

65
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:06,633
 I have a kimono in my closet.

66
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:11,833
 でもずっと着ていません。

67
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:15,571
 But I haven't worn it for a long time.

68
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,411
 ずっと着ていません。

69
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:22,911
 I haven't wearの過去分詞worn.

70
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:27,131
 I haven't worn it そしてずっとfor a long time.

71
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:28,951
 Let's say it after Jenny.

72
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,591
 But I haven't worn it for a long time.

73
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:40,251
 お正月には必ず着物を着ます。

74
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:44,399
 I always wear a kimono for New Year's.

75
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,399
 母は割とよく着物を着ます。

76
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,159
 My mom wears a kimono pretty often.

77
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,399
 この着物について教えますね。

78
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,639
 I'll tell you about this kimono.

79
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,639
 これは京都で作られました。

80
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,979
 母がくれました。

81
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:14,725
 This was made in Kyoto. My mom gave it to me.

82
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:20,025
 Okay. Did you understand today's phrases?

83
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:25,025
 All right. Now it's your turn to try them one more time.

84
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:28,245
 This is your chance to do a little better than before.

85
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,545
 Jenny will say the answers after the pause.

86
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,905
 So do your best. Okay, let's go.

87
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:45,337
 その着物はあなたにすごく似合っていますね。

88
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:49,077
 That kimono looks great on you.

89
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,417
 日本で買いましたか?

90
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:58,297
 Did you get it in Japan?

91
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:01,437
 どこで買いましたか?

92
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,677
 Where did you get it?

93
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:11,122
 Sono tabi wa doko de kaemashita ka?

94
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:18,382
 Where did you get those tabi socks?

95
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,162

96
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:29,662
 Do you wear a kimono often?

97
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,062
 Kruzetto ni kimono ga arimasu.

98
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,413
 I have a kimono in my closet.

99
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:51,413
 でもずっと着ていません。

100
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,573
 But I haven't worn it for a long time.

101
00:07:56,793 --> 00:08:03,413
 お正月には必ず着物を着ます。

102
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:08,673
 I always wear a kimono for New Year's.

103
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:19,043
 母は割とよく着物を着ます。

104
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:30,723
 この着物について教えますね。

105
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:39,103
 これは京都で作られました。

106
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,483
 母がくれました。

107
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:51,342
 This was made in Kyoto. My mom gave it to me.

108
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,482
 Okay, time's up.

109
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:59,482
 Well, how was your second try?

110
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:01,862
 Jenny-san, kimono mochi desu ka ne?

111
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,802
 Jenny, do you have a kimono?

112
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:09,242
 Well, I don't have a kimono, but I have worn a kimono before.

113
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:11,442
 Was it for a special occasion?

114
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:16,682
 Well, I wore it in Kyoto for a TV show.

115
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:17,659
 Oh, really?

116
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,399
 Someone helped me wear the kimono,

117
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,999
 and I was so impressed.

118
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,939
 There are so many steps to wearing a kimono.

119
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,059
 Well, that's a precious experience.

120
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,999
 So many people come to Japan,

121
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:36,359
 and one thing they want to do is wear a kimono.

122
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,479
 And it's a great chance to have a conversation with them.

123
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,039
 Get on board.

124
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,799
 And let's practice speaking together.

125
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,199
 See you next time on...

126
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,197
 Ikaewa Time Trial

127
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:49,097
 Bye-bye
