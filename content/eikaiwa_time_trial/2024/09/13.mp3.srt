00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:21,115
 Let's get started with Day 10 for the month of September.

2
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,675
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Seresi.

3
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:28,015
 And here's our conversation partner around the Atlantic.

4
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,075
 Hello, everyone. I'm Nora Kennedy.

5
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,135
 Let's have a conversation in Scotland this month.

6
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,015
 Okay, everyone. Here we go.

7
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:42,175
 Taiwa Harake. Around the Atlantic.

8
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,574
 英語でつながる船の旅

9
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:48,554
 今月はスコットランドを訪れます

10
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:52,074
 そして今月の学習テーマは

11
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:55,794
 Dress for success in Scotland

12
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:59,254
 それでは今日の会話の場面を確認しましょう

13
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:01,074
 Picture this

14
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:08,154
 Today you will rent something very Scottish

15
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:09,214
 A kilt

16
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:12,954
 Next week you're going to a special event

17
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,298
 So, today, rent a Scottish outfit.

18
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:21,638
 あなたは来週特別なイベントに行くことになったので、

19
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:27,558
 今日はスコットランドの伝統衣装、キルトをレンタルすることにしました。

20
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:31,538
 Go to a rental clothing store. I will be working there.

21
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,658
 So, tell me your size.

22
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:40,558
 店員さんの野田さんに普段着る服のサイズなどを伝えましょう。

23
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,798
 You can try the clothes on.

24
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:47,343
 So, let's find the right Scottish outfit for you.

25
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:53,543
 着ると試着できるようなので、着心地などを伝えましょう。

26
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:55,883
 Did you picture the situation?

27
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:02,763
 それでは、野良さんの英語の問いかけに対して、ポーズの間に英語で返答しましょう。

28
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:08,883
 So, try to have an eight-turn conversation as you get a Scottish outfit.

29
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,303
 Ready? Start!

30
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:21,062
 Welcome to Atlantic Kilt Rental. How can I help you?

31
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:24,822
 Let me tell you that I want to rent a kilt.

32
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:33,562
 OK. And the kilt will be for you, right?

33
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:44,202
 Are you going to an event, some special occasion?

34
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:55,222
 Okay. How tall are you?

35
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:10,682
 Well, are your clothes usually large, medium, small or petite?

36
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:20,522
 Hmm.

37
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:23,812
 This outfit might look good on you.

38
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:38,592
 Sure. The fitting room is over there.

39
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:45,392
 How does it feel? Too tight? Too loose?

40
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,132
 May I take a look?

41
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,712
 Oh, it fits pretty well.

42
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:02,072
 And it looks good on you.

43
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:03,392
 Look in this mirror.

44
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:09,892
 試着した自分の姿を想像して感想を一言伝えましょう。

45
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,052
 Time's up.

46
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:19,452
 How did you do?

47
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,692
 Did you reply to each one?

48
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,778
 How much did you answer?

49
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:28,238
 Well then, Nora-san and I will have a conversation.

50
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:31,378
 Please check my answer and use it as reference.

51
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:35,338
 Steve will show you one way to reply.

52
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:39,638
 Here we go!

53
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:43,378
 Welcome to Atlantic Kilt Rental.

54
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:45,298
 How can I help you?

55
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:47,698
 I'd like to rent a kilt.

56
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,898
 Okay.

57
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:52,198
 And the kilt will be for you, right?

58
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,743
 that's right I hope you have my size

59
00:04:55,743 --> 00:05:00,383
 are you going to an event some special occasion

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,983
 yes I'm going to a nice afternoon

61
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:07,323
 T and I need to dress for success

62
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:12,003
 okay how tall are you in centimeters

63
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:15,343
 I'm 170 centimeters tall

64
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:19,683
 I'm not sure how many inches that is well

65
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:25,205
 Are your clothes usually a large, medium, small, or petite?

66
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:29,805
 Usually, I wear a large for t-shirts or dress shirts.

67
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,965
 But sometimes I wear a medium.

68
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:36,625
 Hmm. This outfit might look good on you.

69
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,165
 Okay. Is it okay if I try on this one?

70
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:44,805
 Sure. The fitting room is over there.

71
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,385
 How does it feel?

72
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,398
 Too tight? Too loose?

73
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:55,218
 It feels a little loose, but not too loose.

74
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:56,978
 It feels nice and warm.

75
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:59,018
 May I take a look?

76
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,678
 Oh, it fits pretty well.

77
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:06,018
 And it looks good on you.

78
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:07,358
 Look in this mirror.

79
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:12,098
 Wow! I like it.

80
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:12,898
 Hello.

81
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:18,638
 Okay.

82
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,810
 Did you understand our conversation?

83
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,550
 さて、僕がどのように答えたか少し内容を確認しましょう。

84
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,650
 例えば、

85
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,470
 Are you going to an event? Some special occasion?

86
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,050
 それに対して僕は、

87
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,350
 Yes, I'm going to a nice afternoon tea.

88
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,170
 と言ってましたね。

89
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,290
 そしてその後、

90
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,390
 I need to dress for success.

91
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,390
 成功させるためにちゃんとした服を着たいです。

92
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:54,218
 そして一番最後に自分がキルと来た感想を伝える場面がありましたね。

93
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:57,798
 せっかくなので感情を込めて言いましょう。

94
00:06:57,798 --> 00:06:58,658
 僕は、

95
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,358
 Wow! I like it!

96
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,778
 そして最後にスコットランドなどで聞く、

97
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:06,538
 Hello! を言いました。

98
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:07,558
 How would you say that, Nora?

99
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:08,578
 Hello!

100
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,858
 そのようなスパイスを入れてもOKです。

101
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:16,578
 それでは最後にもう一度今日の模擬会話に挑戦です。

102
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,461
 自分なりのヘントできるかどうかチャレンジしてください。

103
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:24,741
 Do your best, everyone. Ready, start!

104
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:34,181
 Welcome to Atlantic Kilt Rental. How can I help you?

105
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:43,021
 Okay, and the kilt will be for you, right?

106
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,514
 Are you going to an event, some special occasion?

107
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,574
 Okay, how tall are you?

108
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,034
 Well, how tall are you?

109
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:19,518
 Are your clothes usually large, medium, small, or petite?

110
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:29,818
 Hmm...

111
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,818
 This outfit might look good on you.

112
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:42,738
 Sure.

113
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,978
 The fitting room is over there.

114
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,518
 How does it feel?

115
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:50,698
 Too tight?

116
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:51,738
 Too loose?

117
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,958
 May I take a look?

118
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:05,618
 Oh, it fits pretty well.

119
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,978
 And it looks good on you.

120
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:09,498
 Look in this mirror.

121
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,016
 Time's up.

122
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,936
 Okay. You did much better the second time.

123
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:24,176
 Well done.

124
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:27,736
 来週の金曜日はキルトを着て

125
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,576
 ロラさんと素敵なイベント

126
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:32,856
 アフトヌーンティーに参加します。

127
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,756
 That sounds wonderful.

128
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,576
 I'm really looking forward to it.

129
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,216
 I love a nice afternoon tea.

130
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:43,056
 Okay, everyone. Get on board.

131
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:46,076
 And let's practice speaking together.

132
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,107
 See you next time on Ekaiba Time Trial.

133
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:50,887
 Bye-bye.
