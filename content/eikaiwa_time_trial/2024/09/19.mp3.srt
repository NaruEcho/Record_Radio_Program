00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:15,932
 A Kiowa Time Trial

2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:21,312
 Let's get started with Day 14 for the month of September.

3
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,912
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Ceresi.

4
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,392
 And I'm Jenny Skidmore. Thanks for joining us.

5
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:31,592
 It's Thursday. Let's practice the phrases we learned this week.

6
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,212
 And we'll get you ready for actual conversations.

7
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:37,292
 All right, let's get started.

8
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:40,872
 Express. Create. Reply.

9
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:41,292
 Hi.

10
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,532
 First, let's do some warming up.

11
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,552
 Step 1. Express.

12
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:52,832
 Ima kara Jenny-san ga konshuu rinshu shita hyougen o

13
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:54,372
 random ni itte kuremasu no de

14
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:57,792

15
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,192
 challenge shite mite kudasai.

16
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:02,312
 And copy my intonation.

17
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,592
 Okay, here we go.

18
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:10,112
 Where did you get that outfit?

19
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:16,455
 Actually, I'm renting this outfit.

20
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:22,455
 It's heavier than I expected.

21
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:28,455
 I love that plaid scarf.

22
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:33,455
 Do you wear plaid often?

23
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:37,575
 I almost never wear plaid.

24
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,390
 All right. Did you express all those phrases quickly and smoothly?

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,890
 And now, let's move on to the next step.

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,990
 Step 2. Create.

27
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,910
 Let's create some original sentences with the phrases that we practiced this week.

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,010
 Here's the first phrase.

29
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,490
 〜何々を着るのが好きです。

30
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,570
 I like to wear something.

31
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:17,748
 So, think about a pattern, like stripes or polka dots, or a color, light blue or dark

32
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:23,348
 blue, for example, and then make a sentence about the clothes that you like to wear.

33
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:24,508
 Are you ready?

34
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,808
 I like to wear...

35
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:27,428
 Go ahead.

36
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:36,468
 Good.

37
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:39,688
 So, let's hear what Jenny likes to wear.

38
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:43,177
 I like to wear colorful outfits.

39
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:44,877
 I see.

40
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:46,797
 Okay, everyone.

41
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,417
 Make one more sentence with the phrase,

42
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,177
 I like to wear 〜.

43
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:52,177
 Here we go.

44
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:02,917
 Very good.

45
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,657
 Now let's go to the second phrase.

46
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:09,217
 〜には似合いません。

47
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:13,664
 〜don'tあるいは doesn't look good on me.

48
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:17,384
 And again, you can think about a pattern or a color

49
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:19,724
 that doesn't look good on you.

50
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,224
 では部分を作りましょう。

51
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,864
 〜don't doesn't look good on me.

52
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:25,784
 Go ahead.

53
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,284
 Okay, Jenny, it's your turn.

54
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:40,492
 Polka dots don't look good on me.

55
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:42,032
 I see.

56
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:45,252
 Now let's make one more sentence.

57
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:48,672
 〜don't, doesn't look good on me.

58
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:49,572
 Go ahead.

59
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,632
 Alright, let's go to the next one.

60
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:05,612
 その〜はすごくかわいいですね。

61
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,327
 That 〜 is adorable.

62
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:09,707
 Adorable.

63
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,067
 とてもかわいい。

64
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,547
 すごくかわいい。

65
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,967
 相手が身につけているものについて文を作りましょう。

66
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:16,387
 Are you ready?

67
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:18,747
 That 〜 is adorable.

68
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:19,687
 Go ahead.

69
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,587
 Okay, let's check out Jenny's sentence.

70
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,612
 That backpack is adorable.

71
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:39,712
 Can you imagine a very cute backpack?

72
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,032
 Backpackはリュックサックのことですね。

73
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:47,932
 Okay, try to make one more sentence with the phrase,

74
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,792
 That 〜 is adorable.

75
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:50,912
 Go ahead.

76
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,289
 Okay, now let's move on to our final step.

77
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:07,329
 Step 3. Reply.

78
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:13,289
 I'll ask a question in English, and you reply in English.

79
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,029
 Here's the first question.

80
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,289
 あなたは着物をよく着るか聞きますよ。

81
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,589
 Do you wear a kimono often?

82
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,789
 And you can start with yes, no, or well, but then add one sentence.

83
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,429
 Try to explain yourself. Are you ready?

84
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:31,773
 Do you wear a kimono often?

85
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:32,753
 Go ahead.

86
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,533
 Very good.

87
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,273
 では、返答例を聞きましょう。

88
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:50,913
 Do you wear a kimono often?

89
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,673
 Not really.

90
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:57,273
 I just wear them for special occasions like weddings.

91
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,007
 Jenny didn't say yes or no.

92
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,807
 She said, not really.

93
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:07,067
 And then, I just wear them for special occasions like weddings.

94
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:08,547
 All right.

95
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,027
 Try to answer this question one more time.

96
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,287
 Do you wear a kimono often?

97
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,107
 Good.

98
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:26,207
 Let's go to the next question.

99
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:32,645
 あなたが今着ている服について、それをどこで買ったか聞きます。

100
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:34,165
 Where did you get that outfit?

101
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,985
 Maybe it was a present, or maybe you bought it somewhere.

102
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,845
 Try to explain in your own words.

103
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:41,885
 Are you ready?

104
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:43,945
 Where did you get that outfit?

105
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:44,925
 Go ahead.

106
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,645
 Alright.

107
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,397
 Let's check out the sample reply.

108
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,657
 Where did you get that outfit?

109
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:06,277
 I got this plaid scarf in Japan, but I almost never wear plaid.

110
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,877
 I got it just for my trip to Scotland.

111
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,097
 Did you understand?

112
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:16,017
 Jenny is imagining she is wearing a plaid scarf.

113
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:16,997
 Plaid.

114
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:17,677
 Chekkagara.

115
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:19,557
 Scarf is mafra.

116
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:23,277
 So she says, I got this plaid scarf in Japan.

117
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:24,737
 That's the answer.

118
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,147
 OK, let's try this question one more time.

119
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,347
 Are you ready?

120
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:31,867
 Where did you get that outfit?

121
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,787
 And now, let's go to the final question.

122
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:52,907
 今月の舞台、スコットランドならではのシチュエーションです。

123
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,367
 あなたが参加しているイベントで

124
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,247
 バグパイプの演奏が始まります

125
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,907
 Have you ever seen a bagpipe?

126
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:03,667
 It's a traditional Scottish instrument

127
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,007
 そこで僕があなたに

128
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,887
 バグパイプの演奏を聞いた感想を聞きます

129
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,467
 What do you think of the bagpipes?

130
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:13,647
 さあ、感想を伝えましょう

131
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:14,567
 いきますよ

132
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,967
 What do you think of the bagpipes?

133
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,247
 Go ahead

134
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,737
 では、返答例を聞きましょう。

135
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,217
 Let's check a sample reply.

136
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,757
 What do you think of the bagpipes?

137
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:40,417
 I've only seen bagpipes on TV.

138
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:44,017
 I've never seen them in person like this.

139
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,677
 It's magnificent.

140
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,677
 その演奏が素晴らしいと言いたいとき、

141
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:54,797
 It's そしてGreat Wonderful あるいはジェニーさんが

142
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:56,677
 Magnificent と言いましたね。

143
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,857
 壮大ですねのようなニュアンス。

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
 All right, I'll ask this question one more time.

145
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,360
 Here we go.

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,880
 What do you think of the bagpipes?

147
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,520
 Okay, time's up.

148
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,360
 Great job today, everyone.

149
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,860
 All right, and tomorrow we have Taiwa Karaoke.

150
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:31,364
 You're going to an afternoon tea in Scotland.

151
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,904
 And of course, you'll be talking about some special outfits.

152
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:38,184
 Because you're going to dress up.

153
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:41,524
 Try to use the phrases that we practiced this week.

154
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:44,124
 So everyone, get on board.

155
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:46,884
 And let's practice speaking together.

156
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,484
 See you next time on...

157
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,164
 Eikaiwa Time Trial.

158
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,064
 Bye-bye.
