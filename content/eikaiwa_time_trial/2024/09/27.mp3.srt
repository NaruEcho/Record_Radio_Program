 アイルランド出身のシンガーがカバーし大ヒットしました。

16
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,849
 And here's another hint. I'll hum the chorus part a little.

17
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:19,266
 So now, can you guess what the song is?

 アイルランド出身の歌手、シェネイド・オーカーナーが1990年にカバーした曲です。

21
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:40,506
 愛する人と別れた悲しみと、その人がかけがえのない存在であることを歌っています。

 I go out every night and sleep all day

24
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:57,655
 Since you took your love

25
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:09,815
 Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want

26
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:14,218
 I can see whomever I choose

27
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:26,218
 I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant

28
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:34,218
 But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues

29
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:37,938
 Cause nothing compares

30
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:53,433

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,789
 I can see whomever I choose.

49
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:09,349
 Okay, it's your turn. Sing along with me.

 All right.

53
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:33,635
 Are you ready for the last part?

54
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,215
 Okay, listen first.

55
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:47,306
 I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant

56
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:54,586
 But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues

57
00:05:54,586 --> 00:06:06,126
 Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you

58
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:14,918
 Okay, do you feel ready for the final part? Let's sing it together.

59
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:31,578
 I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant, but nothing, I said nothing can take away the

 All right, everyone, you did it.

62
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:54,194
 How did it feel?

 That's the most important part.

66
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:04,532
 Here we go.

67
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:13,092
 It's been seven hours and fifteen days

68
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:18,192
 Since you took your love away

69
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:28,972
 I go out every night and sleep all day

70
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,404

00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:42,221
 さて、英語でつながる船の旅はまだまだ続きます。

78
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,181
 来月向かうのは…

79
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,101
 アイルランド!

80
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:53,881
 そうです。今日紹介したシンガー、シェネイド・オカーナーの出身地でもあるアイルランドへと向かいます。

 バイバイ!

87
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:19,487
 Since you've been gone, I can do whatever I want.

88
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,919
 I can see whomever I choose

89

 I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant

90
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:44,919
 But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues

 Cause nothing compares
