 英会話タイムトライアル

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,880
 Let's get started with the fourth day of our special week.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,160
 It's day 19 for the month of September.

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,660
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sarese.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,420
 And I'm Jenny Skidmore. Thanks for joining us.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,340
 今日は特別なチャレンジです。こちら。

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,340
 Reply Around the Globe.

8
00:00:39,773 --> 00:01:09,473
 Tell me about some good or bad food that you've had recently.

9
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:16,928
 最近食べた中で、美味しかった、もしくはまずかった食べ物について教えてください。

10
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:21,048
 Today, we'll introduce the replies from three different people.

11
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,888
 まず一人目です。

12
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:26,808
 The first person we'll introduce is Zoe.

13
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:28,588
 She's from Hawaii.

14
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:36,588
 ハワイ出身のゾイさん、どのように答えてくるのか、早速聞いてみましょう。

15
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:38,588
 Tell me about some good...

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,359
 or bad food that you've had recently.

17
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:45,739
 I ate a homemade pizza that had mozzarella,

18
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,439
 and it was perfectly cooked.

19
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,739
 It was not overcooked or undercooked.

20
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,379
 Ooh, homemade pizza is always the best kind of pizza, isn't it, Steve?

21
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,319
 Yes, if it's cooked perfectly.

22
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:00,599
 Did you hear that?

23
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,039
 It might have been a little too early.

24
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:03,999
 Let's check the content.

25
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,059
 Jenny, can you read Zoe's reply?

26
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,259
 Sure, Steve.

27
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:12,903
 I ate a homemade pizza that had mozzarella.

28
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:19,503
 モッツァレラチーズを乗せた自家製ピザを食べました。

29
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:23,283
 モッツァレラチーズを乗せたという表現は簡単に

30
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:25,703
 that had mozzarella.

31
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:29,503
 最後にon itがなくても表現できます。

32
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:32,143
 And it was perfectly cooked.

33
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:36,043
 It was not overcooked or undercooked.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,640
 完璧な焼き加減で 焼きすぎでも生焼けでもありませんでした

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,980
 完璧な焼き加減 Perfectly cooked

36
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,260
 さあ もう一度 ゾイさんのリプライをチェックしましょう

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,660
 OK Now let's check out Zoe's reply one more time

38
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,020
 Listen closely

39
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,160
 I ate a homemade pizza that had mozzarella

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,860
 And it was perfectly cooked

41
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,140
 It was not overcooked or undercooked

42
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:15,355
 The second person we'll introduce is Dean. He's from Australia.

43
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:28,275
 Tell me about some good or bad food that you've had recently.

44
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,635
 I went to a Greek restaurant for lunch the other day.

45
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:36,696
 And I had the most amazing roast lamb.

46
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:40,956
 And it was the best lunch I've had for as long as I can remember.

47
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:43,436
 聞き取れましたか?

48
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:47,136
 そんなに難しい単語は使ってないですね。

49
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,456
 では、内容を確認しましょう。

50
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:53,096
 I went to a Greek restaurant for lunch the other day.

51
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:59,096
 先日、昼食でギリシャ料理のレストランに行きました。

52
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:02,096
 The other day. これは便利な表現です。

53
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:04,496
 日本語で言う先日。

54
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,536
 いつなのか曖昧です。

55
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:08,636
 だから便利です。

56
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:11,876
 And I had the most amazing roast lamb.

57
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:16,356
 最高のローストラムを食べました。

58
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,756
 And it was the best lunch I've had for as long as I can remember.

59
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:25,356
 覚えている限りで一番の昼食でした。

60
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:31,356
 Deanさんは答えるのにZoeさんと同じように三つの文を言ってくれました。

61
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,620
 それがしっかりしたリプライです。

62
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,540
 基本は文を連続してリプライすることです。

63
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,960
 では、もう一度ディーンさんのリプライをチェックしましょう。

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
 Listen closely.

65
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,340
 I went to a Greek restaurant for lunch the other day,

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,360
 and I had the most amazing roast lamb,

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
 and it was the best lunch I've had for as long as I can remember.

68
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:03,922
 OK, now we'll introduce our last person, Dan from Ohio.

69
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:09,922
 最後に登場するのは、オハイオ州出身のダンさんです。

70
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:10,662
 Let's check it out.

71
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:17,042
 Tell me about some good or bad food that you've had recently.

72
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:23,744
 My mother-in-law made a key lime pie recently that was delicious, one of the best I've had.

73
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:26,844
 And my wife loves liver and onions.

74
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:30,044
 She made it for me, and I thought it was not very good.

75
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:33,604
 Key lime pie, do you know what it is?

76
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,524
 This is actually a dessert from Florida, where I'm from.

77
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:43,344
 It's similar to a rare cheesecake, but it's a pie made with lime juice.

78
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:52,811
 さあ、そんなキーライムパイ、そしてあんまりおいしくなかった料理についてもリプライしてくれましたね。内容をチェックしましょう。

79
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,471
 My mother-in-law made a key lime pie recently.

80
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:01,471
 最近、義理の母がキーライムパイを作りました。

81
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:05,931
 That was delicious. One of the best I've had.

82
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,471
 とてもおいしくて、これまで食べた中で最高のものでした。

83
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:15,292
 And my wife loves liver and onions.

84
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,232
 She made it for me.

85
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:23,072
 また妻はレバーと玉ねぎの炒め物が大好きで、

86
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,552
 それを私に作ってくれました。

87
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,472
 And I thought it was not very good.

88
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,972
 あんまりおいしいとは思いませんでした。

89
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,592
 Good っていうのはおいしい。

90
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:38,872
 Not very good っていうのはあんまりおいしくない。

91
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:41,472
 Delicious を否定文にあんまり使わないです。

92
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:48,665
 つまり、I thought it wasn't deliciousではなくて、ダンさんのように、I thought it was not very good。

93
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:52,285
 それでは、もう一度、ダンさんのリプライをチェックしましょう。

94
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,085
 Listen closely.

95
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:59,585
 My mother-in-law made a key lime pie recently that was delicious, one of the best I've had.

96
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,825
 And my wife loves liver and onions.

97
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:05,945
 She made it for me, and I thought it was not very good.

98
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,585
 さあ、次はあなたの番です。

99
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:27,505
 Just try to reply and make as many sentences as you can in your own words.

100
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,305
 Got it?

101
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:30,545
 Okay, here's the question.

102
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:37,325
 Tell me about some good or bad food that you've had recently.

103
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,165
 Ready? Start.

104
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:01,789
 Okay, time's up. How did you do? Did you make a few sentences in your own words?

105
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:06,529
 それでは、ジェニーさんにも同じ質問に答えてもらいましょう。

106
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:07,169
 Are you ready, Jenny?

107
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,049
 I'm ready, Steve.

108
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,549
 Tell everyone about some good or bad food that you've had recently. Start.

109
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:21,289
 I recently went to an Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.

110
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:30,471
 i had never been there before but i had the most delicious pizza i've ever had in my life steve

111
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:40,231
 wow was it some kind of special pizza i'm not sure if it was the toppings or the bread

112
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:47,831
 but the combination was just perfection all right i'm getting hungry

113
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:53,615
 さあ、それでは皆さん、最後に、せっかくですからもう一度挑戦してみてください。

114
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:56,855
 スムーズなリプライできるように頑張ってください。

115
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,035
 OK, here's the question.

116
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:04,835
 Tell me about some good or bad food that you've had recently.

117
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:23,864
 All right. Great job, everyone.

118
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:30,424
 さて、明日は英語の名曲をジェニーさんと一緒に歌ってみるコーナー。

119
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:31,804
 What's this song?

120
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:35,484
 So let's finish up this month singing together.

121
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:37,424
 お楽しみに。

122
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,264
 So everyone, get on board.

123
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:42,004
 And let's practice speaking together.

124
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,524
 See you next time on...

125
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:46,584
 英会話タイムトライアル。

126
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:47,064
 Bye-bye.
