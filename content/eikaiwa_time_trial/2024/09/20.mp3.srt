00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,589
 Let's get started with Day 15 for the month of September.

3
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:24,349
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sarese.

4
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,929
 Hello, everyone. I'm Nora Kennedy.

5
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,669
 Try to complete a conversation with me today in your own words.

6
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,129
 Okay, everyone. Let's finish up this month.

7
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,549
 It's time for...

8
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:39,909
 Kiowa Parake

9
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,009
 Around the Atlantic

10
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:45,272
 英語でつながる船の旅

11
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:48,612
 あなたは今月スコットランドに来ています

12
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:51,332
 そして今月の学習テーマは

13
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,572
 Dress for success in Scotland

14
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,972
 That's right

15
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,332
 Dress for success

16
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:00,172
 今日はドレスアップしますよ

17
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:02,432
 前回の対話カラオケで

18
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:04,452
 スコットランドの伝統衣装

19
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:07,012
 キルトをレンタルしましたが

20
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:08,652
 今日はそれを着て

21
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,612
 特別な場所に行きますよ

22
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,652
 So

23
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:14,966
 Here's today's scene. Picture this.

24
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:21,646
 Today, you are going to an afternoon tea in a castle.

25
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:28,966
 あなたは今日、お城で開かれるアフタヌーンティーに参加することになりました。

26
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:32,606
 This afternoon tea is a little formal.

27
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:38,546
 And so, you've dressed up in a traditional Scottish outfit, a kilt.

28
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,166
 And I'll be there in a kimono.

29
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:49,747
 今回のアフターヌーンティーは少しフォーマルな内容なので、あなたはキルトを着ていきます。

30
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:53,427
 ノラさんはなんと着物で参加するようですよ。

31
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:57,427
 Picture me in a kimono, and let's talk about it.

32
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:01,487
 And picture yourself talking about your outfit too.

33
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:06,487
 お互いの服装について会話を弾ませましょう。

34
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:08,867
 Did you picture the situation?

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,210
 それでは、野良さんの英語の問いかけに対して、ポーズの間に声に出して英語で返答しましょう。

36
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:24,410
 So, try to have a six-turn conversation as we are dressed for success in Scotland.

37
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,690
 Ready? Start!

38
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:39,010
 Well, look at you! You wore a Scottish outfit, and I wore a Japanese outfit.

39
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:44,935
 野良さんの着物姿を褒めて、どこで手に入れたのか尋ねましょう。

40
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:45,935
 どうぞ。

41
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:55,715
 I love this kimono.

42
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:57,135
 I got it in Japan.

43
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:01,955
 Actually, my homestay family kindly gave it to me.

44
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,175
 Do you wear a kimono often?

45
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:15,326
 Well, your Scottish outfit looks great.

46
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:17,266
 Where did you get that outfit?

47
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:22,286
 あなたの着るとはどこで手に入れたのか聞かれました。

48
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,226
 答えましょう。

49
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:34,666
 You'll fit in with the locals in Scotland.

50
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,726
 And I love that plaid scarf.

51
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,246
 Where did you get it?

52
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:53,127
 That's perfect for today's afternoon tea at the castle.

53
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:57,347
 By the way, do you go to Japanese tea ceremonies often?

54
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:01,347
 日本ではお茶会によく行くか聞かれました。

55
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:03,347
 自分なりにどうぞ。

56
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:11,447
 Oh!

57
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,885
 We have a bagpipe performance.

58
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:15,585
 What do you think?

59
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,765
 Kansou wo sutai mashou.

60
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:33,245
 Time's up.

61
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,645
 How many times did you reply?

62
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:39,865
 Well, Nora, we're talking about afternoon tea in Scotland.

63
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,893
 Have you been to an afternoon tea in Ireland?

64
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:47,993
 Yes, and I've been to afternoon tea in England, in London, for example.

65
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:49,893
 It's a lovely thing to do.

66
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:53,733
 How about tea ceremonies in Japan?

67
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:58,293
 Yes, well, I've lived in Japan for quite a long time.

68
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,733
 So I've been to a number of tea ceremonies in Japan.

69
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,793
 All right, last question.

70
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:08,273
 Tell me your favorite kind of Japanese tea.

71
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:09,433
 I'll go first.

72
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:10,891
 Do you like hojicha?

73
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:13,631
 I like genmai-cha.

74
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,231
 Oh, I like that one too!

75
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,431
 Yeah, it's got a lot of character.

76
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:28,491
 Steve will show you one way to reply.

77
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:29,951
 Here we go!

78
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,631
 Well, look at you!

79
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,011
 You wore a Scottish outfit.

80
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:44,153
 and I wore a Japanese outfit that kimono looks great on you

81
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:47,813
 so tell me about that kimono where did you get it

82
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:52,033
 I love this kimono I got it in Japan

83
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:56,573
 actually my homestay family kindly gave it to me

84
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,393
 do you wear a kimono often not really

85
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:06,073
 I just wear them for special occasions like weddings well

86
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:10,993
 Your Scottish outfit looks great. Where did you get that outfit?

87
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:18,373
 Thanks. Actually, I'm renting this outfit. I wanted to fit in with the locals.

88
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:26,393
 You'll fit in with the locals in Scotland. And I love that plaid scarf. Where did you get it?

89
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:35,733
 Actually, I got this scarf in Japan. But I almost never wear plaid. I got this just for my trip to Scotland.

90
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:40,195
 That's perfect for today's afternoon tea at the castle.

91
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:44,535
 By the way, do you go to Japanese tea ceremonies often?

92
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:46,515
 I've never been.

93
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:49,335
 My mom goes to tea ceremonies, though.

94
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,775
 Oh, we have a bagpipe performance.

95
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:56,475
 What do you think?

96
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,315
 I've only seen bagpipes on TV.

97
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:02,315
 I've never seen them in person like this.

98
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,055
 It's magnificent.

99
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:12,657
 Okay, did you understand our conversation?

100
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:17,357
 Finally, let's try again today's Mogi conversation.

101
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,897
 Instead of answering the same way as my reply,

102
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:24,317
 please challenge yourself to see if you can do your own reply.

103
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:26,657
 Do your best, everyone.

104
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:29,057
 Ready, start!

105
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:35,497
 Well, look at you!

106
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,857
 You wore a Scottish outfit.

107
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:40,418
 And I wore a Japanese outfit.

108
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:51,818
 I love this kimono.

109
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:53,238
 I got it in Japan.

110
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,038
 Actually, my homestay family kindly gave it to me.

111
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,278
 Do you wear a kimono often?

112
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,967
 Well, your Scottish outfit looks great.

113
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,747
 Where did you get that outfit?

114
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,867
 You'll fit in with the locals in Scotland.

115
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,927
 And I love that plaid scarf.

116
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:30,467
 Where did you get it?

117
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,850
 That's perfect for today's afternoon tea at the castle.

118
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,210
 By the way, do you go to Japanese tea ceremonies often?

119
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,450
 Oh, we have a bagpipe performance.

120
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,170
 What do you think?

121
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,370
 Thank you.

122
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,477
 OK, time's up.

123
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:19,477
 Did you reply each time and complete our conversation?

124
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,717
 Well done, everyone.

125
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:25,657
 会話を自分の言葉で完成させましたか?

126
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:30,377
 さて、スコットランドの旅はここまでとなりますが、

127
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:34,677
 今月はもう一週間特別なトレーニングがあります。

128
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:35,997
 Special week.

129
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:40,997
 あなたの英語の瞬発力をさらにアップさせていきましょう。

130
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:43,516
 So, everyone, get on board.

131
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:46,556
 And let's practice speaking together.

132
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,916
 See you next time on...

133
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,436
 A Kiowa Time Trial.

134
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,236
 Bye-bye.
