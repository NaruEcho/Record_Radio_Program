00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:21,445
 Let's get started with day five for the month of September.

2
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,285
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sareisi.

3
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,285
 英語でつながる船の旅

4
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,805
 We're cruising around the Atlantic Ocean.

5
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,385
 そして今月はスコットランドが舞台です。

6
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:39,185
 ということで早速あなたの会話パートナーを呼びましょう。

7
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:40,185
 ノラさんです。

8
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:42,905
 Hi, everyone. I'm Nora Kennedy.

9
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:47,923
 Let's go to Scotland together. We'll have fun conversations there.

10
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:51,103
 Welcome back to A Kiowa Time Trial, Nora.

11
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:52,863
 Great to be back.

12
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:58,083
 So, originally you're from Ireland. We're talking about Scotland.

13
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:00,423
 Have you been to Scotland before?

14
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:08,403
 Yes. Scotland has fantastic Scotch whisky, beautiful mountains and hills,

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,783
 and, of course, castles and great universities.

16
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,601
 So, is it easy to go from Ireland to Scotland?

17
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:19,601
 Sure, it's about a one-hour flight.

18
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,041
 I see.

19
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:23,961
 では、さっそく始めましょう。

20
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:24,841
 Here we go!

21
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:27,141
 対話カラオケ

22
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,121
 Around the Atlantic

23
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:34,121
 ラジオを通して英語で模擬会話をしましょう。

24
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:36,141
 今月の学習テーマを覚えていますか?

25
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,881
 Dress for Success in Scotland

26
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:45,007
 衣服や服装にまつわる会話に挑戦しましょう。

27
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,847
 So, let's check out today's scene.

28
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,887
 今日の会話の場面を確認しましょう。

29
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:51,867
 Picture this.

30
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:57,807
 You're going to a world famous lake in Scotland.

31
00:01:58,427 --> 00:01:59,887
 It's called Loch Ness.

32
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,847
 あなたは今日スコットランドの有名な湖、

33
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,847
 ネスコに散策に出かけます。

34
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,087
 I'll show you around Loch Ness.

35
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,651
 I'll be your guide.

36
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:17,051
 散策ガイドの野良さんがネスコを案内してくれます。

37
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:19,411
 The autumn leaves are breathtaking.

38
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,871
 It's one of the most beautiful scenes in northern Europe.

39
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,271
 But the weather can change easily.

40
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:33,271
 紅葉が美しい季節ですが、天気が目まぐるしく変わる時期でもあります。

41
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,251
 It's a little chilly.

42
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,564
 And it might rain at any time.

43
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:43,744
 So, we'll talk about proper clothes for the weather, too.

44
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:49,844
 天気や服装などについてガイドの野良さんと会話をしましょう。

45
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,764
 Did you picture the situation?

46
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:57,764
 それでは、野良さんの英語の問いかけに対してポーズの間に返答しましょう。

47
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,144
 自由回答です。

48
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:05,644
 So, try to have a six-turn conversation as we walk around Loch Ness.

49
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,163
 Ready? Start!

50
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:16,163
 Welcome to Scotland's famous Loch Ness.

51
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,163
 Beautiful lake, isn't it?

52
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:30,163
 This might be the most beautiful autumn scene in Europe.

53
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,163
 Oh, a little rain is coming.

54
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,443
 Well, I have ponchos for everyone.

55
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:41,135
 レインコートを用意してくれたようです。

56
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,695
 一言返しましょう。

57
00:03:48,695 --> 00:04:01,735
 9月にしては暖かいですねと言われました。

58
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:02,695
 答えましょう。

59
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,512
 Is Japan cold in September?

60
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:23,512
 Well, I get cold easily, so I wore lots of layers today.

61
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:26,272
 Do you know what I mean by layers?

62
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:27,852
 Layers.

63
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,632
 Let's answer as we please.

64
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:44,133
 I'm wearing my leggings and my undershirt.

65
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:48,793
 Now I'm a little hot and feel overdressed.

66
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,813
 Do you get cold easily?

67
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,513
 How did you do?

68
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,573
 Did you reply each time?

69
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,733
 You don't have to reply every time.

70
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,851
 この後もう一度挑戦します。

71
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,431
 その前に少しノラさんと天気について話しましょう。

72
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:19,071
 So, Nora, at this time of the year,

73
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:22,371
 how's the weather in Scotland and Ireland?

74
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,671
 Well, the truth is it could be terrible.

75
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,071
 It's totally unpredictable.

76
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:30,591
 I see.

77
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:31,671
 Totally.

78
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,871
 全くunpredictable.

79
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:35,871
 予測できません。

80
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,871
 天気が変わりやすい時期ですね。

81
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:39,491
 それでは、

82
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,031
 Nora-san to boku de kyou no kaiwa wo shite mimasu.

83
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,191
 Boku no hento wo cheku shite, sanko ni shite mite kudasai.

84
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:49,031
 Steve will show you one way to reply.

85
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,471
 Here we go!

86
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:56,191
 Welcome to Scotland's famous Loch Ness.

87
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,191
 Beautiful lake, isn't it?

88
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,711
 Yeah. The autumn leaves are so colorful now.

89
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:08,431
 This might be the most beautiful autumn scene in Europe.

90
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,137
 Oh, a little rain is coming.

91
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,057
 Well, I have ponchos for everyone.

92
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:16,697
 Here's a poncho for you.

93
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:22,157
 Thanks, but I brought a foldable umbrella.

94
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:23,577
 Thanks anyway.

95
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:29,837
 Oh, the rain has stopped and the sun is out.

96
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:32,777
 It's warm for September, isn't it?

97
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:36,037
 Yeah, it's not too cold today.

98
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:38,577
 Is Japan cold in September?

99
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:45,347
 Not really. It's getting cold. But usually, we have nice, warm, sunny fall weather.

100
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:54,267
 Well, I get cold easily. So, I wore lots of layers today. Do you know what I mean by layers?

101
00:06:54,267 --> 00:07:02,067
 I think so. In Japanese, layering is kasanegi. Most people wear layers in winter.

102
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,687
 I'm wearing my leggings and my undershirt.

103
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:13,363
 Now, I'm a little hot and feel overdressed. Do you get cold easily?

104
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:21,443
 Yes, I do. I get cold very easily. I'm always cold, so I always wear layers.

105
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:27,083
 Okay, did you understand our conversation?

106
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:31,343
 So, let's try again today's Mogi conversation.

107
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:33,203
 Please try to give your own answer.

108
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:39,253
 do your best everyone ready

109
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:45,193
 start

110
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:48,353
 welcome to Scotland's famous Loch Ness

111
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:55,353
 beautiful lake isn't it this might be

112
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:01,873
 the most beautiful autumn scene in Europe

113
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:09,418
 Oh, a little rain is coming. Well, I have ponchos for everyone. Here's a poncho for you.

114
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:25,658
 Oh, the rain has stopped and the sun is out. It's warm for September, isn't it?

115
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:32,918
 Is Japan cold in September?

116
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:47,318
 Well, I get cold easily, so I wore lots of layers today.

117
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,318
 Do you know what I mean by layers?

118
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:02,318
 I'm wearing my leggings and my undershirt.

119
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:07,318
 Now I'm a little hot and feel overdressed.

120
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,318
 Do you get cold easily?

121
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,810
 Time's up.

122
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,010
 Did you reply each time and complete our conversation?

123
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,470
 Great job this week.

124
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,610
 さて、来週はスコットランドならではの衣装、キルトについて話しましょう。

125
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,190
 Let's talk about Scotland's national dress, the kilt.

126
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,170
 So everyone, get on board.

127
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,330
 And let's practice speaking together.

128
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,390
 See you next time on Eikaiwa Time Trial.

129
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,170
 Bye-bye.
