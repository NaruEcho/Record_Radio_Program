1
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:21,287
 Let's get started with Day 8 for the month of September.

2
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:23,787
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sareisi.

3
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:27,287
 And I'm Jenny Skidmore. Thanks for joining us.

4
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:31,147
 This time, we're going to practice expressions about the comfort of wearing clothes.

5
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:37,227
 Remember basic expressions such as tight and loose and use them in the sentence.

6
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,707
 Okay, it's time for your first try.

7
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:45,778
 S.P.R. Training

8
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:51,978
 では日本語を時間内に英語で言ってみてください

9
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:57,978
 最初の文に行く前に試着するを英語で言ってみよう

10
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:01,898
 試着する

11
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,758
 Try on

12
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:04,538
 何々

13
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:06,038
 Try on

14
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:06,738
 を使います

15
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:09,478
 ではそれを使ってこちらを言ってみよう

16
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:12,895
 Can I try on this shirt?

17
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:13,975
 Here you go.

18
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:24,395
 Before we move on to the next sentence, let's say 試着室 in English.

19
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:32,275
 Depending on the store, the fitting room is common.

20
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,775
 Let's use the fitting room to say this.

21
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:39,195
 Which is the fitting room?

22
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:46,877
 How does it feel?

23
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,877
 Let's check the answer here.

24
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:55,877
 How does it feel?

25
00:01:55,877 --> 00:02:00,877
 Let's use this sentence instead of the word, how does it feel?

26
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:03,877
 How does it feel?

27
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:10,877
 If you use the word, feel, while talking about clothes, you can express how you feel.

28
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:14,077
 So, let's use the word, feel.

29
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:16,657
 Kigo-gochi ga ii desu.

30
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:22,657
 Dewa, tsugi desu.

31
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,577
 Kitsui desuka?

32
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:30,957
 Kotae wo iimasu.

33
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,577
 Is it tight?

34
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,997
 Yofuku nado ga kitsui to iitai toki ni tight o tsukaimasu.

35
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:38,257
 Is it tight?

36
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,557
 Sa, tight o tsukaitte kochira wo itte miyo.

37
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:44,337
 Sukoshi kitsuku kanjimasu.

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,630
 Before we move on to the next sentence, let's say the opposite of tight, yurui, in English, please.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,170
 The answer is loose.

40
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,970
 Let's use the word loose to say this.

41
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,130
 Is it too loose?

42
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,330
 It feels a little loose, but it's not too loose.

43
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:28,116
 では、次の文に行く前に、この語彙を確認しましょう。

44
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,876
 洋服が縮む。

45
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,336
 How do you say 縮む in English?

46
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,956
 The answer is shrink.

47
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:38,936
 一回言ってみよう。

48
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:39,536
 Shrink.

49
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:42,036
 Good.

50
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,676
 では、それを使ってこちらを言ってみよう。

51
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,976
 このTシャツは縮みますか?

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,160
 少し縮むかもしれません

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:07,860
 OK, how was your first round?

54
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,960
 Did you try to say each one?

55
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,300
 ではここで回答例をチェックしましょう

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,600
 OK, now you can check your answers with mine

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,420
 And if you have our textbook

58
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,340
 You can open it up and follow along

59
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:25,027
 このシャツを試着してもいいですか?

60
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,547
 Is it okay if I try on this shirt?

61
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,507
 May I try on this shirt?

62
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,887
 も伝わりますが、

63
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,467
 Is it okay?

64
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:36,847
 と聞くと、

65
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,127
 このお店のルールとしては、

66
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,927
 試着してもいいかどうか聞けます。

67
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:42,747
 ですので、

68
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,267
 Is it okay if...

69
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:48,087
 さあ、一回ジェニーさんのあたりに行ってみよう。

70
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,367
 Is it okay if I try on this shirt?

71
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:58,777
 では、次です。試着室はどちらですか?

72
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,337
 Where is the fitting room?

73
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,057
 着心地はいかがですか?

74
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,337
 How does it feel?

75
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,757
 着心地がいいです。

76
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:15,337
 It feels nice.

77
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:18,977
 キツイですか?

78
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:21,217
 Is it tight?

79
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:21,417
 Is it tight?

80
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:27,692
 あるいは、 Does it feel tight? でも正解です。

81
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,652
 次の文にfeelが入りますよ。

82
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:31,892
 こちら。

83
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:34,592
 少しきつく感じます。

84
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,852
 It feels a little tight.

85
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:40,972
 ゆるすぎますか?

86
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:43,652
 Is it too loose?

87
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:50,852
 少しゆるい感じがしますが、ゆるすぎではありません。

88
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:55,122
 It feels a little loose, but not too loose.

89
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,402
 このTシャツは縮みますか?

90
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:03,342
 Will this T-shirt shrink?

91
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:08,642
 日本語のTシャツは英語で言うと、

92
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:12,402
 一枚ならTシャツ、単数形で表現します。

93
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:13,682
 Will this T-shirt shrink?

94
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,842
 一回ジェニーさんのあたりに行ってみよう。

95
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:18,842
 Will this T-shirt shrink?

96
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,907
 では次です。

97
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:26,847
 少し縮むかもしれません。

98
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,607
 It might shrink a little.

99
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:33,927
 Okay, did you understand today's phrases?

100
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:39,707
 それでは皆さん、今学習した表現をテンポよくもう一度言ってみましょう。

101
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:42,107
 We'll pick up the pace a little in round two.

102
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:43,527
 Here we go!

103
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:48,607
 このシャツを試着してもいいですか?

104
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,606
 Is it okay if I try on this shirt?

105
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,906
 試着室はどちらですか?

106
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,026
 Where is the fitting room?

107
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,926
 着心地はいかがですか?

108
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:15,726
 How does it feel?

109
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,646
 着心地がいいです。

110
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,226
 It feels nice.

111
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:28,626
 Kitsui desu ka?

112
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,266
 Is it tight?

113
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,966
 Sukoshi kitsuku kanjimasu.

114
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,946
 It feels a little tight.

115
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,546
 Yurusugi basu ka?

116
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,867
 Is it too loose?

117
00:07:55,487 --> 00:08:08,087
 It feels a little loose, but not too loose.

118
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,187
 Will this T-shirt shrink?

119
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:29,667
 It might shrink a little.

120
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,687
 Okay, time's up.

121
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,207
 Well, how was your second try?

122
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,767
 Today we talked about clothes.

123
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:43,147
 How they feel, tight or loose, and whether they shrink.

124
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,687
 Jenny, do your clothes shrink often?

125
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:51,168
 Well, sometimes if I dry them in the dryer.

126
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:52,368
 You have a dryer.

127
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:56,048
 Jenny-san no uchi ni kansouki dryer ga arimasu.

128
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:59,288
 Dryer to iu to daitai kansouki wo sashimasu ga,

129
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:03,348
 kaminoki no dryer wa hair dryer to itta hou ga wakari yasui desu.

130
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,588
 So you don't dry them outside.

131
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,388
 I usually dry them in the dryer.

132
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:14,728
 But if something might shrink, I usually dry it in the drying room.

133
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,823
 You have a drying room? Oh, in the bathroom.

134
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,403
 Yes, in the bathroom.

135
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:25,363
 I can choose cold air to dry it, so then I know it won't shrink.

136
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:26,623
 I see.

137
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:28,503
 みなさんはいかがですか?

138
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,363
 What do you do so your clothes don't shrink?

139
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:36,463
 Okay, let's learn some useful phrases and have some good conversations.

140
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:39,163
 So everyone, get on board.

141
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:41,863
 And let's practice speaking together.

142
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,183
 See you next time on...

143
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,138
 ekaewa time trial

144
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,058
 bye bye
