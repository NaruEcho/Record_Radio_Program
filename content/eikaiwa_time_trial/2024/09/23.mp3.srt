 即座に英語で表現していくトレーニングです。

13
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:03,801

16
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:17,967
 出かけする2人の着替えにまつわる会話のやりとりを英語で表現しましょう。

17
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:22,967
 さあ、お手本として僕とジェニーさんでいくつかのやりとりをやってみます。

18
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,967
 今日のSPR Rubik'sはこんな感じです。

19
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,287

 Did you change?

25
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,350
 Did you understand how to practice?

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,850
 You don't have time to think about it.

27
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,530
 Try to express Japanese in English at a good tempo with the speed of the moment.

28
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,690
 Then, let's get started.

29
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,690
 Let's get started.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,950

 洗濯したばっかりだよ。

37
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:52,889
 縮んだ?

38
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,569
 縮んでないよ。

39
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,569
 きつく感じる。

40
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,569
 かっこいいよ。

41
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,029
 きつすぎない?

42
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,049
 鏡を見て。

43
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,293
 Ah, it's all right.

44
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,093
 Don't forget one more thing.

45
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,213
 Ah, I know.

46
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,293
 Put the dirty clothes in here.

00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,613
 Now, let's go out.

50
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,180
 Okay, good job. How was your first round?

51
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,620
 一回目はすべてできなくても大丈夫です。

52
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,380
 ここでジェニーさんに挑戦してもらいます。

53
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,940
 それぞれ英語でどのように表現するのかチェックしてみてください。

54
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,240
 余裕のある方はジェニーさんと一緒に英語で言ってみてください。

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,960
 So now it's your turn, Jenny. Are you ready?

56
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,460
 Yeah, I'm ready, Steve.

57

70
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,407
 もう行く時間だよ

71
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,687

 今着替えるから。

73
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:47,807
 I'll change now.

74
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,027
 何を着るの?

75
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,167
 What are you wearing?

76
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,867
 まだ考え中。

77
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,947
 I'm still thinking about it.

78
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,387
 ほら、これを着て。

79
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,067
 Here, wear this.

80
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:04,367
 これ、きれい?

81

 Is this clean?

82
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,127
 洗濯したばっかりだよ。

83
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:10,767
 I just washed it.

84
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:13,247
 縮んだ?

85
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:15,228
 Did it shrink?

86
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,868
 縮んでないよ。

87
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,548
 It didn't shrink.

88
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:22,828
 キツく感じる。

89
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:24,688
 It feels tight.

90
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:27,728
 かっこいいよ。

91
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,948
 It looks good.

92
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:31,108
 キツすぎない?

93
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,568
 It's not too tight?

94
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,388
 鏡を見て。

95
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:37,668
 Look in the mirror.

96
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,668
 あ、大丈夫だね。

97
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,748
 Oh, it's fine.

98
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:47,902
 Don't forget one more thing.

99
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:52,742
 Oh, I know.

100
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,062
 Dirty clothes go here.

101
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:06,402
 Got it. Done. Okay, let's go.

102
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,862
 Okay, did you understand how to express those phrases?

103
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:18,557
 まず出だしの方をスムーズに言えるようにそれぞれチェックします。

 そして 着替えた?っていうのは

 Did you change?

110
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:35,097
 Did you change your clothes?は言わなくても簡単に

111
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:36,117
 Did you change?

112
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:39,717
 その他チェンジの入った表現もありましたね。

113
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,157
 急いで着替えてっていうのは

114
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,477
 Hurry up and change.

115
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,778
 短く言えますね。

116
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:47,358

 まだ考え中っていうのは、

122
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,818
 I'm still thinking.

123
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,478
 そして、about it.

124
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,278
 I'm still thinkingでも正解ですが、

125
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:08,878
 よくabout itをつけます。

126
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:15,504
 それではみなさん、このエスピアロビクスにもう一度チャレンジしましょう。

127
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:16,364
 どれぐらい言えるかな?

128
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:21,264
 OK, everyone. It's time for your second try. Let's go!

129
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,624
 出かける準備はできた?

130
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:29,344
 まだ。

131
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,924
 着替えた?

132
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:37,664
 いや、まだ。

133
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,416
 Hurry up and change your clothes.

134
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,256
 What time is it now?

135
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,716
 It's time to go.

136
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,516
 I'm going to change my clothes now.

137
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,416
 What are you wearing?

138
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,616
 I'm still thinking.

139
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:08,016
 Here, wear this.

140
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,721
 これ、きれい?

141
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,881
 洗濯したばっかりだよ。

142
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,201
 縮んだ?

143
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,881
 縮んでないよ。

144
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,881
 きつく感じる。

145
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,881
 かっこいいよ。

146
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,341
 きつすぎない?

147
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,361
 鏡を見て。

148
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:47,208
 Ah, it's okay.

149
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:52,448
 Don't forget one more thing.

150
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,348
 Ah, I know.

151
00:08:56,348 --> 00:09:01,388
 Put the dirty clothes in here.

152
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:02,408
 Roger that.

153
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,388
 Completed.

154
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:04,948
 Now, let's go.

155
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:13,101
 All right. Good job, everyone.

156
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:17,761
 Were you able to say those phrases a little better than the first time around?

157
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,521
 SPR Robics, it's your first day. Good job.

158
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:28,461
 Each of them were short expressions, but you can say them instantly, so you don't have to practice.

159
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,581
 Thanks for practicing.

160
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:34,101
 And tomorrow, we have more SPR Robics.

161
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,541
 Tomorrow, we will increase the speed of the sprint.

162
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:40,401
 So everyone, get on board.

163
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,150
 And let's practice speaking together.

164
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,710
 See you next time on...

165
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,370
 Ekaewa Time Trial.

166
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,250
 Bye-bye.
