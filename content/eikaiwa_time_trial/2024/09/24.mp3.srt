00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:20,875
 Let's get started with the second day of our special week.

2
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:24,095
 It's day 17 for the month of September.

3
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:26,635
 Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Sareisi.

4
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:30,095
 And I'm Jenny Skidmore. Thanks for joining us.

5
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,195
 Special week, second day.

6
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:36,755
 Let's train your sprinting ability with this training.

7
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:42,793
 SPR Robics.

8
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:48,473
 それはリズムに乗って即座に英語で表現するトレーニングです。

9
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:53,053
 今回は新しく買った服についての会話がテーマです。

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,433
 Let's try phrases from a conversation about clothes.

11
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:04,033
 それでは僕が言う日本語をビートに乗って英語で瞬時に表現してみてください。

12
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:04,693
 You can do it!

13
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:06,333
 Alright, let's get started!

14
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:09,613
 ただいまー。

15
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:13,595
 Welcome back.

16
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:17,595
 How are you?

17
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,595
 I'm fine. Where have you been?

18
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:27,595
 Shopping.

19
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,595
 What did you buy?

20
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,595
 I bought a shirt.

21
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,155
 You bought a shirt again?

22
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:43,478
 It's a check shirt.

23
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,038
 Another check shirt?

24
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:52,858
 This is a different one.

25
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,078
 Can I look at it?

26
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:57,298
 Can I look at it?

27
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:00,978
 Sure.

28
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:02,078
 Ta-da!

29
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:06,478
 No comment.

30
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,438
 You don't like it, do you?

31
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:15,807
 It's not bad.

32
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:21,087
 This one has an orange color.

33
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:26,707
 You can tell by looking at it.

34
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:31,347
 Orange is an autumn color.

35
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,027
 Well, it's a nice shirt.

36
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,107
 Huh? Where are you going?

37
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:51,555
 I'm going shopping too.

38
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:55,555
 What are you going to buy?

39
00:02:55,555 --> 00:03:01,555
 My new autumn clothes.

40
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:16,762
 Have you ever bought something new, and then, when you got home, maybe something similar was already in your closet?

41
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:21,462
 I know that's happened to me quite a few times, Steve.

42
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:27,662
 そうですね。同じようなものを買ってしまうことはありますよね。皆さんいかがですか?

43
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:33,282
 それではここでジェニーさんに今回のエスピアロビクスに挑んでもらいます。

44
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:37,579
 それぞれ英語でどのように表現するのか チェックしてみてください

45
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,619
 OK, listen closely

46
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,399
 ただいま

47
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,399
 I'm home

48
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,579
 おかえり

49
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,839
 Welcome back

50
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,339
 げんき?

51
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,699
 How you doing?

52
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,839
 げんきだよ どこにいてたの?

53
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,639
 Good, where'd you go?

54
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:00,359
 おかえもの

55
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,999
 I went shopping

56
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:04,704
 何を買ったの?

57
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:06,584
 What'd you get?

58
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,304
 シャツを買ったよ。

59
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:10,724
 I got a shirt.

60
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:13,064
 またシャツを買ったの?

61
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,344
 You got another shirt?

62
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,544
 チェックのシャツだよ。

63
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:20,064
 It's a plaid shirt.

64
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:23,004
 またチェックのシャツ?

65
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,164
 Another plaid shirt?

66
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,584
 これは違うもの。

67
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,184
 This one is different.

68
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:32,884
 見てもいい?

69
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:34,683
 Can I see it?

70
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,303
 いいよ。じゃじゃーん。

71
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,663
 Sure。

72
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,303
 タダー。

73
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,843
 No commentです。

74
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,603
 I have no comment.

75
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:48,303
 気に入らないんだね。

76
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,983
 You don't like it.

77
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:53,203
 まあ、悪くないね。

78
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,023
 Well, it's not bad.

79
00:04:58,503 --> 00:04:59,823
 これにはオレンジ色が入っている。

80
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:01,463
 This has orange in it.

81
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,601
 見ればわかるよ。

82
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,061
 I can see that.

83
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:10,581
 オレンジは秋の色だし。

84
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:12,501
 Orange is a fall color.

85
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,561
 まあ、素敵なシャツだね。

86
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,421
 Well, it is a nice shirt.

87
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,881
 あれ、どこに行くの?

88
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,181
 Hey, where are you going?

89
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,281
 私も買い物に行ってくる。

90
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,101
 I'm going shopping too.

91
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:30,701
 何を買うの?

92
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:32,444
 What are you going to buy?

93
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,504
 私の新しい秋の服

94
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:38,584
 New fall clothes for me

95
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:44,924
 So, did you understand how to express those phrases?

96
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:48,844
 では、ここでいくつかの表現を確認しましょう

97
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:51,844
 まず、日本語のただいま、おかえり

98
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,624
 I'm home, welcome back

99
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,044
 そこスムーズにぜひ言ってくださいね

100
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,144
 その後、元気?

101
00:05:58,144 --> 00:05:58,544
 元気?

102
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:18,883
 これを英語で言うとHow are you? あるいはHow are you doing? これがスタンダードですが会話表現としてYouをやにしてHow are you doing? また同じような会話表現としてWhere did you go? を言うとWhere did you go? もちろんWhere did you go? でも大丈夫です。

103
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:27,583
 そして日本語でシャツと聞くともしかしてシャーツと複数形で表現してしまうかもしれないんですけれども今回は

104
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,991
 単数形のshirt

105
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:32,091
 例えばシャツを買ったよっていうのは

106
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,371
 I got a shirt

107
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,251
 I bought a shirt でもいいです

108
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,971
 そして楽しい表現ありましたね

109
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,311
 ジャジャーンっていうのは

110
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,491
 タダー

111
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,451
 一回ジェニーさんのあたりに行ってみよう

112
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:45,111
 タダー

113
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,551
 そしてノーコメントですっていうのは

114
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,851
 ノーコメントだけでもいいんですが

115
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,371
 このような文でよく使います

116
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,311
 I have no comment

117
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:55,491
 タダー

118
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,949
 そして会話の最後の方に、私も買い物に行ってくる。

119
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,109
 I'm going shopping too.

120
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:08,249
 このスタンダードな文、ちゃんと言えるように頑張ってください。

121
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:13,609
 それでは皆さん、このエスピアロビクスにもう一度チャレンジしましょう。

122
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,589
 OK, everyone. It's time for your second try. Let's go.

123
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:22,189
 ただいま。

124
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,869
 おかえり。

125
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:28,907
 How are you doing?

126
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:32,787
 I'm fine.

127
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,067
 Where have you been?

128
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:38,587
 Shopping.

129
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:42,987
 What did you buy?

130
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:46,947
 I bought a shirt.

131
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,387
 You bought a shirt again?

132
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,227
 It's a check shirt.

133
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,298
 Also, checkered shirt?

134
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:04,118
 This is a different one.

135
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:08,218
 Can I see it?

136
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:08,538
 Can I see it?

137
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:12,158
 Sure.

138
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:13,118
 Ta-da!

139
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:17,738
 No comment.

140
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,418
 You don't like it, do you?

141
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,398
 Well, it's not bad, is it?

142
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,122
 This one has an orange color in it.

143
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,322
 I can tell by looking at it.

144
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:43,082
 Orange is the color of autumn.

145
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,782
 Well, it's a nice shirt.

146
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,262
 Huh? Where are you going?

147
00:08:57,822 --> 00:08:59,402
 I'm going shopping too.

148
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,713
 何を買うの?

149
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,713
 私の新しい秋の服。

150
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:16,833
 OK. Great job, everyone.

151
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:21,593
 Were you able to say those phrases a little better than your first time around?

152
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:25,693
 Thanks for practicing speaking with SPROvics.

153
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,893
 二日目のSPROvics、お疲れ様でした。

154
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:33,886
 さて、明日はイディオム集中特訓です。

155
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:37,246
 覚えていくと便利なイディオムを身につけて、

156
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:40,386
 文の形で表現できるようになりましょう。

157
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:42,166
 So everyone, get on board.

158
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,866
 And let's practice speaking together.

159
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,446
 See you next time on...

160
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:49,506
 英会話タイムトライアル。

161
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,286
 バイバイ。
